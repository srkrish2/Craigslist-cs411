Runs/drives well and haven't had any problems with it. Well maintained, original owners! Clean title in hand. Only reason for selling it is I want something with better gas mileage for my commute. Front bumper is bent down a little bit and there is a dent on the driver's side near the tailgate (see pics). I am willing to meet anywhere for convenience and am NEGOTIABLE ON PRICE. I'm aware it's an older truck with quite a few miles, but still is a very strong dependable truck. Just moved from Arkansas and didn't have any problems with a 2,000 mile drive. Best way to reach me during the day is email or text. ASKING 8,000 OBO don't be afraid to make me an offer. I WANT TO SELL so let's make a deal!!

A fully restored MGB MK IV Roadster that is. And that's exactly what your looking at here. Enter this premium example of one of Britain's most iconic sport cars. Manufactured by the British Motor Corporation from 1962 through 1980 the MGB was to become one of a family of MG's biggest sellers, with over a half a million examples being sold throughout the series. Light, agile and super fun to drive are just some of the hallmarks of this little beauty. In this cars case there is little left of the patina that is usually associated with cars of this era as it has been fully refurbished from top to bottom and front to rear. Just about everything has been lovingly replaced with new old stock components and where original parts could not be found, the substitution of some very high quality aftermarket parts have been used. New wiring harness, updated cooling system, complete with new radiator, hoses, thermostat, water pump as well as the stock pulley driven cooling and a supplemental electric cooling fan system to boot. Look closely at the pictures and you will see the results of countless hours of work and dollars invested in the restoration of the car. The car runs, drives and handles better than new. Come on down to Raphael Luxury Motor Cars and take a trip in this ""way back time machine"" and experience for yourself a little slice of motoring history ""British"" style! Call 360-373-6758 for more information on this sweet little roadster.

It's in pretty good condition with some cosmetic dents to the body, some missing parts and cracks in the interior/dash- but otherwise in pretty great shape and has no rust. Has been used as both a daily driver and a 4x4(works) weekend adventure-mobile since I've gotten it and has never let me down from the coast all the way to snoqualmie pass. As far as I can tell the heat and A/C work but the fans don't blow very hard. I have replaced the oil filter adapter seal, motor mounts, transmission mount, rear diff has been refilled and sealed. I have done regular oil changes and changed the transmission fluid a few months ago. Door brackets/pins and liftgate support struts have also been replaced, and I installed a Pioneer usb/cd receiver. It has virtually brand new Goodyear Wrangler 225r75 tires on it (purchased ~4k miles ago - not pictured).Here is the build sheet directly from Jeep: https://www.jeep.com/webselfservice/BuildSheetServlet?vin=1J4FJ68S1TL310056Cons: When replacing the motor mounts, I discovered that a bolt that mounts the bracket to the passenger side engine engine is shorn off into the block - so it is held on by two out of three bolts(I replaced with grade 8). I have not had any issues with this setup, but it is something you should be aware of. Also, I believe either the RMS or Valve Cover Gasket is leaking ever so slightly, which is pretty typical for 4.0L Jeeps. I haven't had to top off oil in between changes so I think this is a *very* slow leak.Bike racks/dogs are not included.Asking $3000 cash. I'm not in any sort of hurry to sell this, but am willing to entertain offers. I will consider trades for high-end steel bicycles, CF road bikes, vintage synthesizers, or acoustic guitars.

This low amount of miles makes this vehicle incomparable to the competition. Intricately stitched leather and ergonomic design seats are among the details in which test drivers say that Audi RS 5 is in a league of its own More information about the 2015 Audi RS 5: The 2015 Audi A5, S5 and RS5 are a family of compact luxury coupes and cabriolets. While the powertrains and some of the performance hardware are different among the three models, much of the same features are carried over and they have essentially the same seating space and design, though coupes have seating for five while cabriolets can seat four. The A5 lineup offers a good alternative to the BMW 3-Series, Cadillac CTS coupe and INFINITI Q50 coupe. In S5 form, it offers one of the best compromises between ride, comfort and performance of any of these models, while the RS5 takes performance coupes to a new level, with 0 to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds, according to Audi. With the Audi Connect system and revised MMI controller and its live Google Earth maps, it has one of the best (and best-looking) infotainment systems. Strengths of this model include stylish interior, excellent quattro all-wheel drive system, great soft-top arrangement in the cabriolet, advanced infotainment and connectivity, Strong, responsive, fuel-efficient powertrains, and nicely proportioned exterior *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

Start enjoying more time in your new ride and less time at the gas station with this 2014 BMW X1. Enjoy the comfort and safety of this AWD BMW X1 xDrive28i equipped with many standard features found on other vehicles as optional equipment. You can tell this 2014 BMW X1 has been pampered by the fact that it has less than 46,023mi and appears with a showroom shine. Intricately stitched leather and ergonomic design seats are among the details in which test drivers say that BMW X1 is in a league of its own More information about the 2014 BMW X1: At about 175 inches long--a little longer than the Range Rover Evoque, a little shorter than the Audi Q5--the BMW X1 is roughly the same length as a compact sedan, so parking and maneuverability will be easy. It also makes more of available space than some other small crossover vehicles, thanks to a low cargo floor and flat-folding seats. And while the X1 offers a lot of practicality and versatility--as well as EPA fuel economy ratings of up to 33 mpg on the highway--it promises good performance. Even with the turbocharged 4-cylinder in its sDrive28i guise, the X1 can accelerate to 60 mph in just 6.2 seconds. Interesting features of this model are Space-efficient packaging, rakish exterior, strong performance, easy parking and maneuverability, extensive option possibilities, and luxurious interior *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

Under 68,000 miles, 2 owners, garaged since new, as close to excellent condition as you'll ever find.This has the 5.7L Hemi V8 with the optional 8spd automatic. When combined with the cylinder shut down, the truck gets up to 24mpg on the highway.  Full option package with factory NAV, remote start, back-up camera, super nice alpine surround stereo, heated and cooled leather seats (driver and passenger, both in perfect condition), heated steering wheel, factory tow package with OEM trailer control, sliding moon roof, newer Cooper tires, etc.  Runs perfect, never smoked in, detailed and maintained regularly. Without a doubt the best truck I've ever owned, and it has the comfort and options like a Cadillac.  Truck was over $50k new.  Not a nicer high option - low mile truck on the market for close to this price.  Wife's new car is on the way so pricing the truck below market for a quick sale.  Truck can be shown by appointment in the Silverdale area after 5pm daily or on the weekend.Note To Buyers:  I have clear WA title in my name.  New owner will not take possession until I have either cash in my hand or my bank (Navy Federal) verifies funds are confirmed into my account.  No shipping, Paypal, Bitcoin, etc.  Dealer contact is welcome only if you're interested in buying the truck at the listed price.  As I've had issues in the past with some less than honest folks, test drives will be with me in the truck and only after I see your driver's license and proof of insurance.

Mercedes Benz of Bellevue is honored to present a wonderful example of pure vehicle design... this 2013 Toyota FJ Cruiser only has 32,016mi on it and could potentially be the vehicle of your dreams! How to protect your purchase? CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee got you covered. Treat yourself to an SUV that surrounds you with all the comfort and conveniences of a luxury sedan. This 4WD-equipped vehicle will handle beautifully on any terrain and in any weather condition your may find yourself in. The benefits of driving a 4 wheel drive vehicle, such as this Toyota FJ Cruiser , include superior acceleration, improved steering, and increased traction and stability. It's not often you find just the vehicle you are looking for AND with low mileage. This is your chance to take home a gently used and barely driven Toyota FJ Cruiser. More information about the 2013 Toyota FJ Cruiser: The FJ doesn't try to fit in as a family vehicle, or sacrifice some off-road ability in the name of comfort; its singular focus is ruggedness and trail prowess--and it really looks the part, with its retro-fashionable design harking back to the 1960s-era FJ40 trucks. The FJ's tough, body-on-frame construction means that a few bangs or dents from boulders won't get in the way, while a rugged, straightforward interior design, with water-resistant seats and a rubberized floor, really fits the purpose. Those looking to get not only the most rugged off-road ability but also a more fashion-forward urban look will want to get the Trail Teams Edition Strengths of this model include distinctive Trail Teams Edition, strong powertrains, all-weather traction, rugged and retro looks, and Uncompromised off-road ability *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

Source: KBB.com  * Very fuel-efficient diesel; very quick gasoline engines; serene ride; rich interior appointments; roomy backseat; top crash scores. Source: Edmunds  * Every element of the 2015 M-Class cabin is thoughtfully engineered and elegantly crafted to make you feel at home, and in control, on any road. The standard 19-inch alloy wheels further accent the already stark design of the M-Class. Bright white LED Daytime Running Lamps help increase the visibility of your vehicle to oncoming traffic by illuminating front lights whenever the car is switched on. On the inside, wood trim adorns the console, dash, steering wheel and doors. MB-Tex upholstery offers a rich appearance and supple leather-like feel, even in cold weather. Electrically heated front seats quickly take the chill out of even the coldest day. 60/40 split-folding rear seat backs with flip-forward seat cushions allow for a truly flat cargo floor. The Cockpit Management and Data (COMAND) system features a high-resolution color-LCD display. This is utilized to manage audio, video, and other hands free calling and navigation functions. The M-Class features a 302hp 3.5L V6 with up to 6,600lbs of towing power or a 329hp or 3.0L biturbo V6 with 7,200lbs. The 7-speed automatic has been made even smoother, more responsive and more efficient while paddle shifters allow you to manually upshift and downshift with just a flick of your fingers. Powerful 4-wheel disc brakes grant you the all of the stopping power that you need. Mercedes-Benz is concerned with keeping the family safe, and the quality of the safety options present on the M-Class is proof of that. A suite of standard air bags offers advanced protection. A driver's knee air bag supplements the dual-stage front air bags. Enjoy the strong, controlled stopping power of dual-circuit power-assisted 4-wheel disc brakes, backed by an Antilock Braking System.

True mileage unknown.I love this Brat and have had a lot of fun with it, but it is time to pass it on for someone else to enjoy. I've done a lot of work over the past couple years, so mechanically it is really solid! It could use some cosmetic attention, but I just don't have the time to do it. The black stuff you see in the door jambs and under the hood is Ziebart rust protection done when the car was new. This would be a perfect Brat for somebody with the time to finish the bodywork. As it sits, it's a cool survivor with some great mods and rare parts that gets tons of smiles and waves every time I drive it!New parts, upgrades, and good Brat stuff!-Resealed stock EA81 with SPFI fuel injection swap.-Brand new aftermarket header and catalytic converter, 2005 WRX muffler-New starter-New electric fuel pump, new fuel filter-5-speed dual range swap, new clutch and resurfaced flywheel, I used all the stock interior trim and 4wd lever-New waterpump, new radiator-Resealed and rebuilt oil pump-New front CV axles-New front ball joints-New brakes front and rear, new master cylinder-Rear disc brake swap from turbo Subaru RX-14"" Peugeot steel wheels-New (slightly oversized) General Altimax Arctic studless snow tires-One extra 14"" Peugeot wheel and extra spares of the special Pug lugnuts-Set of 4 Peugeot wheel center caps (Rare!)-Many extra SPFI spare parts, basically enough to do another whole swap. ECU, distributor, two throttle bodies, extra harness, sensors, etc.-All bed chrome intact and in good condition!-Have good condition seats and seat frame for the bed, previous owner removed them-Working factory AM/FM stereo-GemTop canopy-Aftermarket trailer hitch with 2"" ball-Spare set of 13"" black steel Subaru wheels with decent but old tiresSome bad things:-Some rust at the front of the rockers needs to be repaired, a little in the bed, but overall it's pretty solid for a Brat. Previous owner coated some of the surface rust in the bed with some sort of epoxy.-Steering wheel vibration at highway speed that I haven't been able to solve. Might be the new front CV axles, or some bushings or something like that.

Car has 131,xxx miles, It's a very reliable car. I've never had any issues with it. I've owned it since the vehicle had around 60,000 miles on, I used it as my daily driver until about 8/2015. I have driven it every other week to keep it running and in good shape. It has a new battery from 2017, the tires have less than 10,000 miles on them, purchased tires 4/2015 from Costco. The outside of the car does have a few dents/scratches here and there, nothing to really diminish the beauty of it. As for the interior it's in fairly good shape. There is 1 small burn hole in between the driver and passenger seat and the back seat has some spots on it as well from when my son was a baby. The steering wheel has faded a bit as well from use. Otherwise it looks great, doesn't smell or have any odors. Recently had oil change and a tie rod replaced, only needs an alignment. I plan on getting that done soon, unless it sells first.Sound package Addition/Upgrade if you're interested: I have a new upgraded double din Radio with all needed adapters to attach to steering wheel controls, etc..  Also a 10"" sub with amp (no wires included) to give it an extra boost if you love music like me.

Clean title. Brand new plugs and egr valve. Fantastic engine but rough idle. Fuel gauge not working properly so possible fuel pump issue is cause of rough idle. Inside driver interior handle not working and left passenger door doesnt open. Shakey steering wheel. New rotors and rims may do the trick. Tires in good condition. Solid and strong transmission.  Only used Chevron fuel with Techron and oil changes at 1500 mile intervals.  All lights inside and out work. There are no leaks whatsoever.  Been very dependable until rough idle started just a week ago. Hard to part with this vehicle. Great  sentimental value. I've driven this for 8 years and never once had an issue. Until a week ago with the rough idle and shakey steering wheel. I know there is much more this Tahoe has got in it to offer. Maybe think about it before just parting it out. Just needs a couple things fixed. This Tahoe will need to be towed until the fuel gage and pump are fixed. $30 part. I have given an honest accurate account. Make offer.

The car is currently not fully operational: transmission is throwing error/code (see details below): it goes into ""Trans Failsafe"" mode which is 5th gear, so technically will drive under its own power once it gets going, but not recommended for long distance: I recommend towing it away. Sports Package (difference to regular/base 4.4i) is: 19"" Wheels specific to Sport Package V8 X5s, Sport Seats with Thicker Side Bolsters and Adjustable Thigh Support w/3-Setting Memory, 3-Spoke Sport Steering Wheel (with Audio and Phone controls), Stiffer/lower suspension with rear air suspension tuned for sportier ride and handling). Other desirable options are: * Class 3 (2"") Trailer Hitch Receiver:  Towing capacity of this X5 is rated at 6,000 lbs with trailer brakes. * BMW Navigation System with 6-CD Changer in trunk * HomeLink (programmable home & garage door opener)* Myrtle Wood Trim / HID Xenon Headlights  VIN: 5UXFB33512LH35408 2002 BMW X5 4.4i Sport Engine: 4.4L V8 32-Valve 290 horsepower @5400rpm / 324 lb-ft torque @3600rpm Exterior Color: Silver [Good Condition 7/10] Interior Color: Black Leather [Excellent Condition 9/10] Title: Clean Washington State title in my name.  This is my personal car and a private sale.  Free of liens.  Title in hand ready for immediate transfer.Accidents:  None.  Verified with VIN History check and general condition of the car History:  Originally a California car, and then lived in Washington state the remainder of its life.  So NO RUST. Mileage:  133,440 miles [accurate as read from ECU/instrument cluster via scanner software (even though you cannot see from gauge cluster): I have printout as proof.]Pros:* Sport Package, Clean exterior and interior, Towing Package, Accident-Free, Clean Title * Relatively new tires (Nitto Motivo performance all-season tires), plenty of life left* Relatively new brake rotors/pads* Recent ignition coil replacement with Bavarian Autosport units (all 8) & engine tune-up* Entire cooling system (weak point in these cars due to all the plastic components) has been replaced: new water pump, belts, tensioners, radiator, coolant hoses/pipes* All electrical functions work: door remote, windows, lights, locks, sunroof, rain-sensing wipers, rear suspension air bags, etc. * Car starts up without drama every time  * I am the 3rd ownerCons: * Transmission has an issue, but I don't know exactly what.  When I read the codes in INPA, it states that slippage is detected: input and output speeds different.     The previous owner, who daily drove it for 8+ years, had the transmission rebuilt and said that after a few months, it started to slip and it would throw the ""Trans Failsafe"" error which locks the transmission into 5th gear (making it hard to get going from a standstill or uphill, but once you get going, the car will drive).     The car will slip from 1st gear, and when it senses the slip, it will go into limp mode.  Reverse gear is totally fine, no slippage and drives normal.  It's the forward gears.     I bought the car in this condition from the car's 2nd owner (who had it for almost 10 years), thinking it would be an easy fix (I experienced the same symptoms on my other X5, and it was the ABS Module that needed to be rebuilt).  I suspected the valve body, as is common in this ZF 5HP24 transmission, so recently (May 2018) I dropped the transmission oil pan, cleaned it up (no metal shavings on the magnets), replaced the filter, o-ring, and gasket, and flushed and refilled the transmission fluid a total of 4 times with Pentosin ATF1 fluid (recommended fluid per ZF and BMW).  I removed the valve body and replaced with a brand new unit from RevMax Converters in North Carolina (they specialize in performance automatic transmissions:  https://revmaxconverters.com/ ).  All-in-all cost for this was over $1000.  But unfortunately, the symptoms are still there.  I don't know what else might be the issue and now I don't have much time and losing the space to store the car, so looking to sell.Other than that, no huge issues: just some minor things:* Front passenger door handle carrier is broken (replacement is ~$20 each and not terribly hard to do): so must be opened from the inside (or lower down windows using key remote fob and pull handle from inside).* Left driver's side mirror is cracked and the heated mirror's oil spilled out* Fuel gauge doesn't register, shows empty even after I put in 6 gallons of fuel.  Computer scanning software shows that fuel level sensor is faulty, so change that out.* Fog light warning: front left bulb out (H3 Bulb ~$8)* Pixels missing in gauge cluster (super common issue), so cannot make out exact mileage [can read via scanner, though]* Pixels missing in navigation screen* Hazy headlights: could use a polish* Normal wear and tear for a 16-year old used car.  2 cuts in the rear bumper and scratch (from being keyed?) on the left rear quarter panel is the worst of it.Car is worth more in parts, but I don't have the space or time to part it out.  You can buy and part it yourself and recoup your purchase, or if you are handy and know these cars, you can attempt to fix the transmission and have a nice X5.Pre-Purchase Inspection (PPI) will be on your dime, but I will help out as best as I can (keep in mind I can't drive it to the station, so you'll have to pay to have it towed there and back).  Test drive / in-person inspection for serious buyers are OK.  Recent (6/2018) VIN History Report and AutoCheck VIN Report available upon request.Currently located in Issaquah, WA.  Looking to sell for cash only.In your email, please say what city you are located (this is to filter out spam and generic emails such as ""Is the car still available?"" or ""Will you sell for $X?"" which I will not answer).  *** If the ad is up, it is still available.  I will take it down as soon as I have cash in hand and therefore the buyer has the title.  *** Thank you for reading.Edit: The car does not have the running boards as shown in the photos as I swapped them out with my other X5.  I have uploaded a few photos of it in its current condition without them.",5UXFB33512LH35408,good,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,133440,silver,mid-size,clean,automatic,SUVhttps://seattle.craigslist.org/see/ctd/d/2010-gmc-sierra-2500-hd-4x4/6629416387.html,2010 GMC Sierra 2500 HD 4X4 SLE,2010 GMC Sierra 2500 HD 4X4 SLE,_GMC_Sierra 2500 HD 4X4_,19488,"Come get a great deal on this .

They start with the mechanicals from a Mustang Cobra SVT, which include a hand-built 4.6 liter 32-valve overhead cam aluminum V8 with a 5-speed manual T45 transmission, connected to the Cobra IRS rear suspension with limited slip differential.  The engine is 320 HP, making for spirited performance.The body and frame are fabricated of aluminum and carbon fiber.  The interior has leather power seats, A/C, cruise, power windows, power mirrors, traction control, power top, and a nice stereo. So it is like an exotic car in appearance, performance and construction (same market as Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Lotus), but it can be repaired and maintained with parts available from Ford and local parts suppliers.  Panoz also sells parts for the car.The car is in excellent condition, both mechanically and cosmetically.  It has about 75,000 miles (less than 5,000 per year).  The original owner had the car in Utah until about 2015, with the CarFAX showing regular servicing.  The front fascia was recently repainted to eliminate paint chips that have occurred through the years, it has a new battery, and the rear shock absorbers were recently rebuilt and recalibrated for better performance.  It includes the factory tool kit and owners manual.NADA shows these with an average retail value of $56,000.  As a low volume, high performance car, they should appreciate through the years, making for a sound investment.  I believe that the total production run was about 235 cars.The car can be viewed at my home between Marysville and Arlington.

Price is 100% firm.Posting a feeler ad to see if I get any interest on my MK4 Supra. It's my pride and joy. I've been building this car from when I was 16 until now. It started off as a N/A. Not accepting any trades at this time and no I don't need any help or assistance selling this car.I've had this car for the most part of my older life. I can honestly say, I've done almost everything I'll list to this car with the exception of the new clutch, flywheel, transmission, driveshaft, and rear differential which was replaced at Intec Racing in Kent, WA. I've driven it maybe 200 miles since.I'll keep it as simple as possible, if you're truly interested contact me for more details.- Clean Title- 1996 - Toyota Supra - Originally a N/A. But I've literally swapped everything you can put on a turbo car on this one and more!- JDM 2JZGTE with around 84k now by my calculations. I still warm her up once in a while and drive her around when I'm in town. - V160 and entire drivetrain have less than 200 miles on them since I installed it.- T-61 SPBudget Turbo Kit;Tuned very conservatively on 16psi. Makes just under 500RWHP and that's more than enough for me.- Wahlbro 255 Fuel Pump - 550CC Injectors, if you want to make more power just upgrade injectors and retune. - FMIC with all piping and BOV flange welded in.- Exhaust is custom made and fitted with 2 catalytic converters so it actually passed Smog in California even with the Single Turbo kit.- Apexi Intake - Turbo Heat Wrap- HKS SS BOV- MAP ECU standalone - Samco Hoses- Megan Radiator - Megan Upgraded Thermostat- Greddy Strut Tower- Greddy Turbo Timer- Recaro Confetti Seats. (I also have a pair of Recaro Pole Positions as well that can be negotiated into the deal for an additional amount.)- Tein Suspension- 19"" Gramlight 57s Pros with Titanium Lip. Staggered. New Rear Tires (I've never seen another supra, let alone any other car with these wheels.)- Rotora BBK all around, front and rear.- OEM 98+ Taillights- Boost and Oil Pressure/Temp Gauge- OEM UKDM Glass headlights, stupid rare and expensive if you can find them. Prevents all the haze and any issues you'll ever have in the future with headlights.- The entire interior is brand new. I have all the old plastic interior pieces so you can see what I've bought. There is literally over 8-9k worth of interior pieces I've bought brand new from Toyota. Some are still in the bags unopened. I'm meticulous and I would prefer it to be perfect. Still needs the rear trunk pieces installed. The paint is Aspen White. It was out of commission for over a year and over 100 man hours of labor getting this car to look as nice as she does. No corners were cut. The paint is virtually flawless.- Stillen side skirts and front bumper- Personal Detchable Steering Wheel- APR CF Mirrors (Not Installed.)- Pioneer Bluetooth audio/aux/iPod enabled indash.-  New Toyota Floor Mats- Oil always changed with Motul every 5,000 miles.- VIS Carbon Fiber HoodThere is a ton of stuff I am forgetting to list. Just know I've had this car for nearly 15 years, it's moved with me to California and back to Washington and even for a 5 year period, had exchanged owners to one of my friends in LA who put no more than 500 miles on it in 5 years!39,500 and you get everything else extra for it.

Tabs are due this month and there is a crack in the windshield. Again, 18 year old car for under $1000. Please dont waste my time or yours if you want a perfect car.

More information about the 2014 Audi A6: The 2014 Audi A6 is a mid-size luxury sport sedan that offers strong performance while also delivering all-weather confidence and good gas mileage. Interior and backseat space are also a bit better than in other rear-wheel-drive European sport sedans, and the interior appointments themselves stand out as more fashion-forward. Audi claims best-in-class fuel economy for the 2.0T model, which achieves up to 24 mpg city, 33 highway. A new 3.0 TDI clean diesel offers even more impressive fuel economy, with returns of 24 mpg city and 38 mpg highway. Advanced technology--whether for safety, information, or entertainment--is where the A6 really shines. It offers blind-spot monitors, a night vision system, a head-up display, parking sensors, adaptive cruise control and other leading-edge safety features. The A6 is also ahead of the curve with its excellent MMI Touch system, which includes a simplified interface and a scratch-pad controller that lets you input addresses by tracing individual letters. Meanwhile, the S6 remains a performance standout, with performance that propels it to 60 mph in just 4.8 seconds. This model sets itself apart with strong performance, MMI Touch interface, impressive fuel-efficiency from TDI diesel, Stylish interior, advanced safety features, and magnificent high-end audio systems *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

A supercharged V6 in the S4 brings an impressive level of performance to a practical 4-door.

More information about the 2017 Toyota Prius v: One of the most remarkable things about the Prius is how little it asks from the owner in exchange for its legendary fuel efficiency. Special fuel isn't needed, and there's no need to plug the standard Prius into the wall at night. Further, drivers are not consigned to a tiny interior and miniature storage space, and finally, premium mileage numbers don't have to cost an arm and a leg. The Prius drives, handles and behaves just like any other mid-sized car. It just happens to get the kind of fuel economy that can impress almost anyone. Starting at around $25,000 the Prius is competitive with other cars in its price bracket, offering ample interior space, a quiet comfortable ride, plenty of interior gadgets and world-famous mileage figures. With the all-new Prius Prime plug-in's range of up to 600 miles means there's nowhere that can't be gotten in a Prius. This model sets itself apart with Fuel economy, sharp styling, plug-in option, quiet interior, excellent interior room, and reasonable price *Money-Back Guarantee is valid for 5 days or 250 miles, whichever comes first.

I bought it last year from the second owner of 23 years. He took amazing care of this truck. Unfortunately I have to sell for financial reasons but hope it goes to another enthusiast. Good tread on the tires, locking canapy topper painted to match white paint job. Has new Pioneer CD player stereo with USB and aux input. Runs like a dream. Has factory pop up sunroof which is removable, factory power windows, factory clock and tachometer. A really well designed truck with lots of cool options but no AC. Has mechanical carburator from an 84 720 which works way better than the early fuel injection system it came with and is larger and more effective than a Webber setup. Comes with a few extra parts the previous owner gave me like an extra glass for the sunroof. Has jump seats in back area too. Interior is in great shape, no issues. 140k miles. Registered in Oregon with yellow period plates that come with the truck. Never needs to be paid for every year like a normal registration as it is a Special Interest tag as a classic vehicle. 5 Speed manual transmission, 2.4 liter NapZ in line 4 cylinder.

I love these cars and always wanted one. I bought this about a week ago. It runs, drives and stops. It needs some work so I thought I'd take a stab at fixing it. But I give up because I'm not that mechanically inclined I guess. I'll list the goods and bads. Good:Body is actually in pretty good shapeInterior is in good shapeTires have good tread leftPower rear window works normally Brand new oil and filterBrand new front wipersBrand new rear shocksBrand new transmission fluidBrand new transmission filter AND all 3 shifter solenoid'sBrand new air filterAll the seats are in good shape. No rips or tears. Registration tabs are current. Bad:-Needs power steering hose or pump. Leaking from somewhere. -Leaks oil-Transmission shifts in and out of gear and flashes a code for shifter solenoid number three. I've already replaced it so I don't know what's wrong. Maybe a loose connection? I don't have the time or money to invest into this. But for the price, you have a great start so a great ride. Very low mileage for the age.Will probably need to be towed although I just drove it home from Bothel without a tow. Come get it today! Thanks.

I'm a foreigner who had some holiday here, but I need to leave soon, so I'm selling it. DEQ just done, and a car inspection too.The previous owner told me everything works well, but not really.-There is a leak somewhere. I don't know what it is. After driving a while, it can smell like burned oil. But I didn't have any problem.-Car mechanic said that one front lower suspension ball joint should be changed in the future.-Odometer doesn't work, except those last days, it started to run again, but randomly (from previous owner, who had the car for 1 year, the odometer stopped to work 6 months ago. So have to add around 5000 miles from previous owner, and no more than 4 thousands from me. Cheap to fix)-(Previous owner) Small dent in driver rear quarter panel from a low impact collision in parking lot, superficial damage.-Rear right door don't open from inside. Back door don't lock with the keyless entry, have to do it manually (previous owner)-All leather in correct condition4 wheel drive V-6 w/Automatic transmissionA/C6-disc CD playerDual power seatsŒæNewer batteryNew tires-Extra set of tires included. Gets around 20-25mpg-Plate is from Washington state.-Tags are expired-Title from Oregon. I still don't have it in hands, cause I was traveling. DMV told me they can send it to the new owner address, so no problem.I m selling it 1300. I think it is fair for someone who has some times to fix the problems.Feel free to contact meThanks",,fair,6 cylinders,4wd,gas,115000,white,,clean,automatic,https://seattle.craigslist.org/see/cto/d/1955-international-r110/6627100517.html,1955 international R110,1955 International R110,,9500,Original clean international pickup comes with many extras... valued by Hagerty.

The les schwab dudes said they're fine just noisy.Struts will probably need to be replaced at some point. When driving over potholes you can hear them working. Check engine light code P0457 is on. I just put a new gas cap on so I'll update if it turns off with that. Doesn't seem like a big issue to fix and it runs fine. I just don't have the time to deal with it. Come check it out, feel free to get at me with questions.
