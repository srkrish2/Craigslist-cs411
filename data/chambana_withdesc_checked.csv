This Hummer is in great condition but does have some minor flaws. For instance, some of the dash and steering wheel buttons light bulbs are out, along with some of the bulbs in the floor board lighting that lights up the word HUMMER in blue when you open up any of the doors. These bulbs are very inexpensive and can be ordered on line or at any repair shop. There are some minor scrapes on the back bumper where the Matte Black has scratched off but no body or physical bumper damage.  Again these are minor flaws and can be seen in the pictures. Normal issues that come with custom adds, bells, whistles and such. 

Overall this vehicle is in great shape. It's performance is superior. The Super Charged V8 engine provides surprisingly fast acceleration for an SUV this size and you can feel added horsepower right away. This Hummer is truly a one of a kind vehicle that I hate to part with. You will not find anything like it anywhere and it no doubt stands alone in the Hummer H2 department. I rarely drive it and it's too bad ass to sit in the garage for 11 months out of the year. It's been well maintained and professionally serviced for the entire time I have owned it. Please text or call with questions.

It runs good. Clean interior.
 
Fact and Issues:
- I bought it 2 years ago at approx. 133000 mileage 
- There is an accidental history with the previous owner (can be seen from the inside part of the front bumper. Picture #23)
- Minor damage on the left corner bumper and small paint scratches and dent (Picture #7, 8)
- Right side small lamp is missing (Picture #3)
- Power steering reservoir has some minor leak, but it has been sealed.
- Speedometer shows 10 mph higher than in gps
- CD is not working (cannot read the CD), but FM/AM is fine and you can use an auxiliary cable to connect with your phone and listen through the speaker in the car.
- No keyless entry. The inside handle of the driver door needs to be held to lock the car.
- Passenger airbag recall from ford

Good things:
- Just changed the tie rods and cv axles for both sides and control arm for the passenger side
- Battery was replaced 6 months ago
- Rear tires were replaced 6 months ago, front tires 18 months ago. 
- Right front wheel bearing was also replaced 1 year ago. 
- It has a big trunk that can connect to the cabin.

Sold as is. The reason selling this car is we need a bigger car for my family.

Miata lovers - NA,1990 mazda miata,Champaign,4500,"One owner, Locally owned 1990 all original Mazda Miata in near perfect condition. Recents: tune up, oil change, new clutch master/slave cylinders, new fuel pump sock, new fuel filter.  New battery (from Honda Civic: bigger, more amerpage) Avg combined MPG: 32! Uses no oil, and is virtually in mint condition.

This lil red babe is an incredible car. Comes with both tops (hard and soft) all original, which means buyer will want to replace the soft top (ca 230 bux). It has cruise, AC, 5sp manual, am/fm, cassette, CD, power windows. This car has zero rust, and near perfect paint. It is a fantastic car with an easy 300k miles left on it. Tires are 85% remaining.

It has become impractical for me to keep. If you know Miatas you know this is rare, and you know the price is great. Drive it home to Argentina if you want. It's that good. So. I'm asking $4,500 OBO, first come, first serve, cash and drive.

Pics easily sent to the interested person/s.

Please do not text me asking me ridiculously obvious questions and wasting my time. I'm too old, and too serious. The price is such that I want the car gone pronto to accommodate other needs, and my old hips are finding it harder to enter and exit the car. But I love it. The most economical vehicle I've ever been personally associated with, going back to the early 60s. ;o)

The title couldn't be located, as a few moves have taken place, and it'd been parked in climate control storage until plates expired, and battery completely died. You'll bring appropriate DMV paper work to be signed, and/as a legal bill of sale.

The interior is in ""like new"" condition.  You won't find another K-5 this age with the interior in this nice of condition.  I bought this vehicle a few years ago in hopes to rebuild.  I put in the following: New Windshield, New Battery, New Rear Drum Brakes, New Front Disc Brakes, New Rotors, New Master Cylinder, New Tires, New Dual Exhaust, All New Fluids, New Plugs and Plug wires, New Valve Gaskets, New gas tank, New sending unit, New Fuel Filter.  This is my sometimes driver vehicle.  I have only put like 500 miles on it in the last 3 years since I have owned it.  The Bad: The exterior needs some body work as seen in pictures.  You can drive this just fine as is but if you really want to have a all ""like new"" vehicle you will need to have a body man to do some work.  The exterior is rhino lined.  If you want a vehicle to drive through the woods or to turn into a mud truck, well this is ready.  If you want a project vehicle that you only need to redo the exterior to have a amazing vehicle then this is your ride. Also, the rear window motor stoped working.  You can put a new one in for like 50 bucks.  I am selling all my toys that only my insurance agent gets rewards from.  I don't ""need"" to sell this vehicle at rock bottom price.

.  If you call then leave a message.  I am usually available most evenings to let you test drive.  This vehicle has all the original sales receipts and owners manual.  The story goes, is that it was stored in a barn for 15 years before I bought it.  That is the reason for the low mileage.  The engine is a 5.7 liter small block 350.  I can't think of anything else.

This car is fully optioned, options available beyond what this car features would only be available by upgrading to an S4. Please note, an S4 of similar age, features and miles blue books over $20k.

The Revo Stage 1 Tune raises horsepower to roughly 260hp and torque to right about 300lb ft. The tune, paired with the manual transmission balance this car very well, smooth, responsive power in every gear.

Cash or cashiers checks only. No PayPal.

FYI: My local credit union holds the Clean Title to the vehicle, I have a loan on the car. When the time comes to make a sale, I suggest we meet at my credit union and ensure everything is done accordingly and vehicle ownership properly documented/transferred. If purchaser is obtaining a loan and needs further coordination, I am more than happy to accommodate. Thanks for looking.

**COMES WITH**
1. Hardtop for winter or coupe mode (comes with a cover for the hardtop too)

There are plenty of cars out there that you can immediately tell the type of person who's driving them (particularly giant lifted trucks (lol)). However, man or woman, young or old, Donald, Hillary or Bernie, this car somehow has no social demographic and everyone with a beating heart can have a good time driving it. If you're looking for something fun to get groceries in, you've found it. If you want something quick and nimble to get away from the cops in during your next bank heist, look no further (payment in non sequential bills if this is you). This little piece of English rally car history has a little something everyone can appreciate. From its' unique take on classic styling, to its' tight and responsive steering, it'll make even a devout nihilist believe they have found a purpose. 

Not convinced??? Well, how about some Pros and Cons???

Pros:

-Really low miles for the year
-Leather seats
-Well maintained and clean interior (it's my girlfriend's car, and she's meticulously, if not annoyingly clean)
-Push manual with paddle shifters (it has get-away car potential) 
-Fresh brake pads
-Mark Wahlberg, Jason Statham and Charlize Theron all looked awesome in the Italian Job remake (they also got away).
-It's a sporty, yet practical car that fits anyone (even Jason Statham)
-Great MPG

Cons:

-You cannot transport lumber 
-Not enough room to transport a family of 12 (possibly 10 with limited leg room)
-It unfortunately does not have an autopilot feature for casual car napping
-It beeps at you to change gears sometimes (actual con, I'll shift when I want to car)

Let me give you the quick reason why this car is so great, and no, it's not because of me. I got ridiculously lucky when I found this car on craigslist a couple years ago. The man I bought it from was the first and only owner, it had just shy of 100k on it, and this man took meticulous care of it. Meticulous to the point where the interior was, and is still in, suspiciously good shape (he may have been a warlock, I'm just guessing here). Meticulous to the point where he gave me, what seems to be, every single receipt for every single service checkup that was ever done to this fine piece of eastern machinery. So you'll inherit that lovely 20 year car biography neatly tucked away in the glove box upon purchasing. 

You may have also seen my recent post for my matte black 350z (because I guess I only need one four door now? For some unknown reason?), I'm bringing this up because I bought this car so I'd have a sporty and reliable car to drive around to save miles on my Z (and also because... more Japanese sports cars is always better). Ironically, I kinda fell in love with this car really fast, so I of course had to buy more cars to save miles on this car. This love also encouraged me to get this baby looking like the gorgeous Blasian super model you now see. Not saying she wasn't hot before she met me, but she's defiantly getting more looks now than ever. Styles change, and she was still wearing a coat from the 90s. So I methodically fixed all the little cosmetic issues that were keeping this long slender Asian princess from getting the respect she deserved, and then took her shopping to pick out a sleek 3m matte black dress to give her more of the 21st century sports car look she wanted so badly (treat your ladies gentleman, they deserve it). 

 Unfortunately, now, at the old and decrepit age of 23, it seems as though my ascension into adulthood has come with a collection of hefty prices. Prices that are clearing out my damn garage. But I've rambled enough. Here's the goods:

-DOHC VTEC - it still pumps power and ticks like clockwork
-Sport breaks - because the VTEC will obviously kill you otherwise
-Really well maintained interior - because of a possible warlock
-Blutooth and Phone connectivity - New Sony head unit to utilize the sound system, and hands free blah blah blah
-Bumping sound system - It's legitimately surprising how great the speakers are, 
-Sparco Shift Knob - I'm keeping the original shift knob to remember how great I had it once, everything else on the car is its' original part.
-Working everything - Please keep it that way if you buy it, it's a small miracle.

I'm fairly certain there is only one goofy problem with the car I could never figure out. The driver's side window controls only work when the door is open. It's like there's a wire that just doesn't quite connect when the door is shut, but when it's open, everything is absolutely fine. It's just a miniscule inconvenience at a drive through, but if popping the door before you order your big mac is your breaking point, then I guess I'm so sorry for wasting your time (that's me being facetious). 

Anywho, I'm Tony, and if you're interested in purchasing my Prelude to indirectly help me finance the payments to the financial institutions whom helped me finance my finance degree, then feel free to give me a text at (Too Wan Sehven) PhOOr Wun SeHVvan - NEIN fore CiXX CiXX. Or email me. But let's be honest here, you're not gonna email me. I priced it based on the other Preludes in the market and the KBB price. I'm friendly and negotiable, so respect me, and I'll respect you right on back.

Side note, I'd love to get my offer price, but if you offer exactly 4200 in cash, I will immediately accept with no negotiations... because it's hilarious.",,excellent,4 cylinders,fwd,gas,120000,,,clean,manual,coupehttps://chambana.craigslist.org/cto/d/73-diesel-powerstroke-55o/6577769970.html,7.3 Diesel Powerstroke F-55O Dump Trk.,2000 F-550 DUMP TRUCK,Powerstroke Diesel 4 x 4,14995,"2000 FORD F/550

Besides that, the body is in really nice shape with good tires. The windshield does have a large crack in it(you may want to get it replaced but, it doesn't bother me.) The air bag light is on but everything works properly. I recently had the following replaced:

lock cylinder for steering column, master cylinder, rear wheel cylinders, rear shoes, rear drum hardware, front pads, EGR valve, Camshaft position sensor, and a new driver side tail light circut board.

It has the all original drivetrain with a LT1 5.7 V8, and a four speed automatic with overdrive 4l60e. It runs and drives strong. The only things that have been done to it mechanically wise are a new, larger Mishimoto radiator to prevent infamous LT1 overheating, a belt tensioner pully as the original started to squeak, MSD plugs and wires, and a K&N cold air induction kit. It also has a converter-back Pypes 2.5 inch exhaust paired with Black Widow Venom 250 mufflers, providing a strong yet quieter drive sound. Inside the interior is also all original, and the carpets are showing stain as pictured. I'm sure a good enough shampoo job could get most of it up. The dash also has sun stain, as does the steering wheel. All four speakers have been replaced, with Kickers in the back and Pioneer in the front. The exterior has minor dings and scratches, I pictured the majority. The clear coat is otherwise perfect, as is the Dark Cherry Metallic paint.

Although it had a rebuilt title and the man selling it to me spoke zero English, after inspecting it and driving it I realized apparently ""rebuilt"" in Spanish also means ""bargain"", so I bought it on the spot. There are three things you learn to love behind the wheel of this mobile defibrillator: the sound of your own car, how slow 80mph can feel, and the ego boost you get when people break their neck trying to get a double take. Now, I can't promise you that everyone will love it, but I can promise that they will look at it anyway. 

You're probably wondering why I would sell something that can literally get you laid by waving at a beautiful blonde girl you're passing on the highway (yes, that actually happened, I couldn't believe it either, coolest moment of my life). Well in short, it's impossible to steer this car past my throbbing car inspired erection.... Just kidding, I graduated college and I'm apparently supposed to be ""responsible"" now and ""grow up and actually use my 2 business degrees"" or some bs like that. Side note, I also moved in with my girlfriend, completely unrelated to that last sentence.... he said sarcastically... 

Anywho, here's what you actually want to know. The goods:

-Upgraded Exhaust (done in Miami, it sounds amazing, it's also the reason the check engine light wont go off fyi)
-Sport front Calipers and Rotors (if you go fast, ya gotta stop fast too)
-Sport Clutch (cuz, duh)
-Sony touch screen head unit (it's got blutooth, usb and aux, it's also sub ready)
-Brand new set of Drift Z Rims and Tires (they both have like 20 miles on them total, you can't have my Lexani rims, sorry)
-Sparco Shift Knob (Literally bought this because I want to keep the old stock knob as a memento, your lucky day)
-Custom front and back bumper (don't hit anything, they were a lot of work to get right dammit)
-Matte Black 3m 1080 M12 car vinyl wrap (because seriously, how awesome does that shit look?)
----The only thing I think is really wrong with the car is a dent in the passenger side door that some asshole left for me. 

I tried to make sure the things I did to the car would make it more awesome, not ricey. I hate ricers, so I hope that you see this as a tasteful, yet maniacally badass car monstrosity. Since I know this will come up, all jokes aside, yes it's a certified rebuilt, I bought it that way in Miami. That being said, rebuilt doesn't mean you get to haggle with me like we're at a Tijuana bracelet stand.  

If you want it, and promise me eye to eye you will take good care of it, I will regretfully barter the car to you in exchange for green rectangles or a certified bank rectangle. 

I'm Tony, number is (ToO-Won-SehVen) PhouR-Wan-Sleven NEIN-Foore-Sixx-Syx. 
If you can read that, feel free to text me, or I check my emails.

***Update - Yes, I'm totally negotiable. The price on the ad is a strategic, yet arbitrarily random number. It isn't firm... Unless you want to pay that number... In which case I will totally take that number.... but only if you insist...
***Update #2 - Unfortunately, I don't want to trade. It's not that I don't like motorcycles, boats, jetskis, lifted trucks, Apache attack choppers and or other asian sports cars. It's just I have too many vehicles as it is, not enough room for them all, and not enough legs and arms to drive them all... that and student loans.... lots of student loans.... soul crippling, car stealing, downright depressing, no default policy having, future economic collapse causing, government organized thievery.

Looking to get a brand new car but didn't want to trade it to the dealership for half of what's it's worth so decided to sell myself.
It has close to 116k miles on it, runs and drives great, no check engine light or any other lights on, have never had a problem with this car since I've owned it.
I heard your suppose to replace the timing belt at or around a 100k on these types of vehicles, so just had that done at 109k and paid close to $500. Put black rims on it a couple months ago, however, it will also come with the original rims. Has good tires with about 75% tread left. Also, had the windows professionally tinted a couple months ago which was $225. 
Everything works great on this car and has since the day I purchased it, never had to put any work what so ever into this car besides routine oil changes, and the timing belt.
Windows, sunroof, heat, air, and 6 cd multi disc Rockford fosgate stereo all work perfect! 
Original owners were an older couple and took great care of the car, no rips or tears in the seats, never been smoked in, and female driven by myself. Asking $5300.
Hate to sell but I don't need two vehicles. No low ball offers please.
I think that about sums it up. If interested or have any questions please call or text

Cost when new was $31,780.

The car has ALL of its maintenance up to date: I got the engine oil, oil filter, cabin filter, and wiper blades replaced a week ago. I also got brand new tires installed about two weeks ago; the alignment was also done at that time. Overall, the car is in pristine condition and you will not have to spend any money on it whatsoever - just buy and drive. The vehicle is very clean as you can see in the pictures.

This car has never been in an accident and hence has a clean title. The title is in my name and I have it in hand. I have all the manuals and both key fobs. Please call or text if you need any more information. Serious buyers only.

Downside: 
Has badly rusted rocker panels and a severe water leak. 
I firmly believe the water leak is a bad 'freeze-plug'. It's 
a fairly cheap part but I'm not able to replace it myself. 
Considering mechanic shop rates and possible towing, 
I cannot financially afford to fix it either. It is driveable 
for short distances, so if you have access to any better 
resources, your repair costs could be greatly reduced. 

It's been very reliable for the nearly 5 yrs I've owned it. 
The only previous repairs I've made was to completely 
redo the front brakes (pads, rotor, calipers, hoses, etc).

Some history: 
The 1st owner was an older individual who owned this car for most its life and did not drive it often, hence the low miles for it being 15 years old. The 2nd owner bought it for his daughter who wanted a bigger car so it was not driven often at all and sat under the sun for about a year.

If you're an up-and-coming mechanic and would like to dabble, this might be for you, though...

As it currently is, this Maxima requires new fron brake pads and rotors, a front brake caliper, and left and right front brake hose replacements--- all of which I'm unwilling to learn to do myself and am absolutely not paying the amount quoted by the mechanic of just a few bucks short of $700.

As well, it has a white paint job with decadent streaks of brown rust which adds jacks**t to its aesthetics. For the incense-lovers out there, the trunk has the slight odor of milk thanks to the roommates of a friend who once had loosely-capped containers of milk in the back that spilled over, (who didn't even have the courtesy to apologize after realizing this, by the way). 

If these are insufficient in offending your senses still, I'd like to take you to the interior which is also not a pleaser for the eyes! Due to a lineage of negligent vehicle owners (including myself, of course), the floors are mucked up and covered with bits of rock and dead leaves, you'd think you were stepping into a state park when you get into this thing for a ride.

On a more serious note, though this car (like myself as a car-owner) is not without its faults, it's gotten me from Chicago to Champaign or vice versa about 15 times in the almost two years I've had it, as well as from campus to the stores on Prospect Ave even more so. It'll definitely get you from A to B, just not every time. I think the highest mileage I had with this car without incident (i.e. something breaking down or in need or repair) was about 1,500 miles. But all I did with the car ws fill the gas, have the oil changed, and refill the under-the-hood fluids when it deserves more care and maintenance, probably.


------------------------------------------


[TL;DR] 

- Needs some brake replacements and repairs. Can't get myself to fix these issues, and after having to deal with many repairs over the course of almost two years of ownership, I'd rather just sell it to someone willing to take care of it. Once the brakes are dealt with, the car will drive well. Otherwise, I'd recommend towing the car, else you'd have to force the car to drive with the brakes clamped down.

-Trunk smells of milk

- The AC works, though it is more refrigerator-cold than freezer-cold.

- The rear left door won't open. Will have to replace the inner locking mechanisms to fix that, which apparently costs a bit in the $300s according to my mechanic.

- Lots of rust on the side skirts and around the rear wheels

- A few dings, scrapes, dents, and a damaged rear-right bumper

- Unappealing, dirty interior floor

- No audio jack to directly connect a phone or audio device, only CD's and cassette tapes. An iClever mini universal FM transmitter will be provided, though it won't suffice if static is a real pain for you

- Took it in to the shop to have the wheels repaired since they were leaking air bad a couple months ago, but the front left still seems to be sagging after having air pumped to 35 psi like the rest of the tires, so that might be an issue after the brakes are done.

So you can drive peacefully knowing if anything breaks, Ram will fix it for free! You can see pictures for the actual conversion, but work that went into the van include:

- 340 Watts Solar with 225ah trojan batteries. This is hooked up to an mppt solar charge controller and an 800 watt inverter. Plenty of power to run my laptop, rice cooker, tv and roku!
- Fully insulated with polyiso and foam.
- Day bed that is a twin in its current form, but it also pulls out and can be as big as a king! There is also plenty of storage with 3 long cabinets under the bed! 
- 32"" LED monitor mounted to the roof that flips down, hooked up to a roku or a laptop. Perfect for watching a movie while in bed!
- Big kitchen with so much coutnertop space! If you love to cook this is a MUST. There is a propane tank in the back to power a camping stove that is included. 
- A dometic fridge is included that is powered by solar. 
- A second cooler is included that I use to store dry foods. 
-15 gallon fresh water tank and 5 gallon dark water tank all powered by a foot pump. I love the foot pump!
- Plenty of storage underneath back kitchen countertops and above the driver/passenger seat in the bulk heads. 

I've used this van for stealth urban camping and for extended camping at national parks as well. Its great for both! 

I am willing to drive the van anywhere in the country to deliver or for someone to inspect, but there will be a nonrefundable deposit required depending on the distance I have to travel. Van is currently in central Illinois.

It is a manual and the engine still runs like a champ. However, it has gotten quite a few issues within the last year or so that caused me to get a newer car to help me in my commute. It is silver, with the hood slightly off color because it is still the primer and I never bothered to paint it. There are no big dents anywhere. 

Currently, the clutch most likely needs replaced, along with the head gasket. It also has an issue with one of the ball joints on one of the tires. The inside is not in the best condition, but also not terrible at all. The gas cap door has an issue that requires you to unlock it through the trunk, but it never hindered me. It also may need a new battery. The tires are relatively new as well. It does have cosmetic damage as it was totaled around four years ago and rebuilt. When it was totaled the only things replaced were the hood, bumper, windshield, and the plastic underneath. 

If someone who knew how to fix this up could do it, this car would run great for another 50,000 miles at least. I took great care of it and want more than it going to waste.

This post is very hard for me to type. I bought this truck nearly 2 years ago to restore. It was and still is in need of help. I bought it from a guy who didn't take care of it and sat for 2 and a half year's.åÊ

I bought it and did extensive work and put ALOT of money into it while it sat at a friend's house. I drove it home the oem exhaust piping fell off from the manifold while taking it on a short cruise that day. Parked it and started going to town on it. I did pace setter long tubes, accel ceramic plugs,ac Delco plugs,new cap and rotor,accel coil,new cam and crank sensor. Can't get any pulse to fire... might be out of timing. I put wayyy too much money I will NEVER get back out of it. I just need it out of my driveway.. sadly I lost interest in it.

I have well over 4k just in additional parts in it just as it sits. Here is a list of things I have done to it so far.

Put a motor in it from a 97 Tahoe with 112k miles.
All moog suspension parts.
New upper control arms,bushings, inner and outer tie rod ends,sway bar links. Leveling keys,helper springs,3""rear blocks.
Swapped a rear end.
New brakes,turned rotors.
E fans
Skyjacker shocks
Pace setter long tube headers
Accel ceramic plug wires
A.c. Delco plugs
Accel coil. Ok I'm forgetting alot at this moment but just get a Hold of me if interested. I will go threw literally everything with you.

It's sitting on 22"" rims right now, tires good. I painted 2 of the rims black the other 2 need sanded down and finished. I have factory rims also. It also has 1""rear hub centric spacers in the rear and .75"" in the front. New led tails..blacked out fronts.. needs a new front bumper and hood(hood has rust)åÊ

It's a 1999 original Denali w 230k miles so it's go it's flaws. Previous owner said trans was rebuilt at 150k. It is a solid truck, I just found something else I'd rather have. Price is firm. So please don't waste my time.. I'm telling you it has it's flaws but if someone would finish it it would be a solid nice truck.

Has front dif drop installed for the added lift. I honestly can keep going on and on about the truck but I'm going to leave this info to someone actually interested in it.åÊ

Idc if you buy it for parts. Just please don't waste my time.

Edit: I pulled the factory intake to carb it. But something serious has came up and I just need it out of my driveway.. .first person to bring me $2000 and a trailer gets it.

Most of the mileage has been accrued on the highway commuting for school and work. It has been a great car for us, extremely reliable, the only problem I have ever had was a bad battery that once replaced has worked perfectly. Averages 25+ miles to the gallon. 

There are two small indentations on the hatchback from a bike carrier, a small dent above the front passenger wheel, a spot of scratched paint on the rear passenger side, and a chip in the front windshield from a rock hitting it on the highway. The chipped area on the windshield has remained the same size through two winter to summer weather transitions.

Upon sale, I will pay the remainder of the balance of the car to Kia Motors Finance and a clean title will be transferred to the buyer.",,excellent,4 cylinders,,gas,95660,green,,clean,automatic,hatchbackhttps://chambana.craigslist.org/cto/d/2014-jeep-cherokee-latitude/6616100573.html,2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Sports AWD 3.2L V6 56500miles Remote Start,2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Sports,"Champagin, IL",16000,"2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude Sports AWD 3.2L V6 56999miles Remote Start - By Owner

I just want this gone, honestly.
The serpentine belt broke which is why it wont start. Unsure if there is an underlying problem that caused it to break or if it waa just worn out. 
The ac needs charged, the heat works as long as there is antifreeze in it, but it does have a slight leak. 
The front two windows dont work. The motors went out on them, and i had my dad lock the drivers side one so it would stay up because it kept falling. 
It has been in a couple of wrecks. 
It's an '04, has had two owners. My husbands grandma, and us. 
I cant remember the exact mileage, but i believe its between 160,000-170,000. The car lasted us a good while and never had too many issues, just basic stuff.

It has been through a professional & meticulous restoration where you can see definitively that no cost was spared. Today it still retains its numbers matching 327/340hp engine and has obtained some exceptional upgrades. It has four wheel disc brakes, newer AC, and a 700R automatic transmission. The nice part about these upgrades is that the integrity of the car was not compromised. These components were built to fit to the car as opposed to the car being modified to accept these updates. Included with this 63 is the original and numbers matching four speed transmission as well as all of its factory components (pedals, brackets, etc.). So bringing it back to factory specifications will always be an easy and readily available option.
