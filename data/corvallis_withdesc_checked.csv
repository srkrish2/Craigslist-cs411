Sorry for the 'novel' in advance.... \/


Due to another baby on the way, I simply needed to get a larger vehicle to fit two car seats comfortably.  I have driven this car over 30,000 miles and it has been outstandingly reliable, practical, fun, and safe.  It has ALWAYS been professionally maintained (see stack of service records for proof) by local fantastic German autoshop, J&J Werkstadt here in Albany, and has never been involved in an accident.

Now the fun stuff!! :D About a year and a half ago (rough estimate.. I lost the original invoice and am waiting for a copy to be emailed to me) I had big plans to turn this car into much more than a simple daily driver for a real estate agent.  I wanted something that was in 'sleeper' territory.  So, here's what I had Double J Motorwerks in Portland do for me:

-Install K04 Turbo with an upgraded big billet wheel
-Install bigger 550cc injectors
-Install tubular turbo manifold
-Cat delete, down pipe installed in its place
-Reconfigured intake solution 
-Custom tune built from the ground up specifically made for my car.  NOT a 'generic' APR tune!!

After everything was said and done, it completely transformed this car.  It has not been put on a dyno, but according to DJM they estimate with this configuration I am likely in the neighborhood of 240-260hp.  They said that the stock exhaust system is a bottleneck, and if I went to a 3"" catback exhaust there would be a lot more headroom! 

Back in May of 2017, I had Les Shwab put a fresh set of Toyo Proxes 4+ tires put on and I'd guesstimate that there is still over 50% tread left on them.  Alignment is still dead center too, I had the tires rotated a few months ago, might be due for another rotation.  

I could literally go on and on about this car as I know it essentially inside and out, so if there are any specific questions/concerns you may have, feel free to reach out to me and I'd be happy to fill you in.  Like I said above about the BIG job from DJM, I will have a replacement copy of the original invoice from that work.  They always get back to me very quickly!  

Here's what I like and dislike about the car.  As much as I wish it were, this car isn't all daisies and butterflies, it's got a few dings here and there and some quirks but.. For being a 16 year old car, it's pretty damn immaculate and I've tried everything in my power (and wallet..) to keep her that way. :)


What I LOVE:

-Car is wicked fast.  Turbo spools up very quickly and will push you back into your seat.  Very little turbo lag :) 

-Interior is damn-near spotless.  Leather seats are in fantastic condition, front and back heated seats all work and are a BLESSING during winter!!

-5 SPEED!!  Finding a CLEAN A4 like mine in a 5 speed is pretty much a unicorn.  

-Sits pretty low stock actually.. I really wouldn't bother messing with the suspension, I think it's at a 'function-ably' friendly level of 'low'.

-Quattro. AWD BABY!!  This car just hugs the road on every corner, you'll never lose traction.  Even during the crazy snowstorm of 2016 (I think it was 2016..?) that buried Albany, I was still very easily able to get to and from the office in this car.  
-Probably a bunch of other stuff that I currently can't think of until I sit in the car again and get reminded. ;)

-Professionally installed single din Kenwood Bluetooth deck (I don't have the model number in front of me currently, but can give it to you on request) by the Stereo Store here in Albany.  It's got loads of settings, handsfree calling (necessity for a real estate agent..), aux, and dual USB ports.  

-On the subject of sound... This car's original Bose system is PHENOMENAL!!  I honestly have had no reason to upgrade it to anything else because it has held up so well!!  None of the speakers are blown or rattling. the dedicated subwoofer is respectable too..  Very impressive for a 16 year old car!!  

-Timing belt + water pump recently serviced.  I don't have the exact date/mileage, it's on one of the yellow invoices from J&J, but I'd estimate it was done about 10k-15k miles ago. 


What I'm Not a Fan of:
-Passenger side rear fender by wheel is dented and 'ripply' looking.  It has been like this since I bought the car and no idea what could have caused it as the paint isn't chipping or anything..  Just strange.  Not super noticeable, just bothers me on occasion when I do see it.  I have a friend that works at Main Auto Body in Salem that got me an estimate to fix it and it really wasn't worth it to me to have it done.  I can share the invoice with you if you do want it, it came to something like $1200.

-Damn check engine light is on because I wanted it to have a more free-flowing exhaust and remove the catalytic converter.  Every time I have my oil changed I have J&J Werkstadt run the codes though just to make sure there aren't any other faults.  So far it has only been the missing o2 sensor due to the down pipe.  If you're concerned, feel free to bring a scanner with you and check it yourself though.  

-On driver side passenger door near handle there is a bit of a nasty 'keyed' mark that has been there since I bought the car.  Luckily, clear coat has not started chipping due to it, which is quite surprising because it is a pretty visibly deep scratch.  Like the bent up fender above, this just has not been on the priority to-do list and wasn't worthwhile to me to have done. 

-The diverter valve may need to be replaced.  Occasionally I will randomly hear the signature 'turbo surge' sound and the last time this happened, it was because the stock DV was sticking.  Dirt cheap fix, you could even do it yourself pretty easily if you wanted. I just haven't had the time.

-Stock clutch.  It still shifts fantastic, but I am sure that this is going to be the next maintenance item as I have been driving this car with this clutch for the past 30,000+ miles.  Just something to keep an eye on.

-Fuel economy is pretty crappy for a 4cyl 5 speed..  Before the new sexy turbo and big injectors I was getting 28+mpg on the freeway but now that's optimistically averaged around 22mpg.  Expect a fuel tank to get you about 330 miles before you gotta fill up.  Oh yeah, and it HAS to be premium ONLY because of the tune.  DO NOT FILL IT WITH REGULAR EVER!!


Okay, that's all I've got for now.  Hit me up with questions.  SERIOUS BUYERS ONLY.  If you have a car to sell first, take care of that before inquiring.  I am not letting just anybody take this bad boy for a spin, you've gotta have financing in order or cash in hand.  Lowballs/trades not considered.  I already bought the replacement vehicle so this car is just sitting pretty until the right buyer comes along.  I have soooooo much money/emotional attachment to this car.

Text/email is quickest way to get ahold of me, but if you leave a voicemail I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible:

It is the W115 body, which makes it a rarity; I have only seen two others in town.  I am the third owner.  It spent the first 40 years of it's life in Southern California so there is no rust and the body is in excellent condition.  Unfortunately I moved back to Oregon and I don't have a place to park it indoors, and I feel like it is not getting the love and care it deserves sitting out under a cedar tree!  It is incredibly reliable, but it could use a tune up since it has been sittting around for so long (I fire it up every month or so, but it's not getting much use).  I was hoping it would be my son's some day, but I just need to face the fact that I don't have time/room for a car that isn't being driven every day!

The Good:
Body is in great shape!
Runs well, no mechanical/engine issues
Low miles: odometer says 65,000, previous owner claimed it was 150,000, so even if you add some extra and call it 265,000 the engine is only halfway through it's life.  This particular car is known as the ""million mile engine,"" google it
30 MPG, not bad for a 40-year-old car
Easy to work on--that's part of the reason I bought it, I like to do my own work when I can.  Therefore...
Comes with specialized tools.  I have a set of custom wrenches, so you can do the valves and change the oil etc.  Plus 2 manuals and a box or two of assorted parts for maintenance
I replaced the injectors recently
It comes with a new stereo, including bluetooth mic for hands-free phone calls

The Bad:
There is some minor fender damage, I tried to show in the picture (near rear passenger-side door).  It was like that when I bought it.  Hardly noticeable.
The seats are starting to give out.  This is extremely common with this car at it's age.  Personally doesn't bother me, but you might need to add some cushion at some point.
Needs a new A/C belt.  If frayed last year so I cut it off because...
Needs the A/C recharged.  The A/C motor and vacuum switch still actually work, but there is no juice inside.
The climate control has issues.  This is the only real issue with the car as far as I'm concerned.  At this point let's just say that it does not have a functional heating/cooling system.  (That's not entirely accurate, as it can be made to wrok, it's just a huge pain and very finnicky, so better to just say it's inoperable).   If I had time this would be the first thing I addressed on this car.  
Oh yeah--the hood ornament came off, but I still have it.  Looks like an easy enough fix but bodywork-type stuff is not my forte.

So anyways there you have it.  I hope you can make a nice home for this awesome ride.  It really drives like no other car I've ever been in--come take a look!",,good,4 cylinders,,diesel,,,,clean,manual,https://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2009-mini-cooper-convertible/6628937654.html,2009 Mini Cooper Convertible,2009 Mini Cooper convertible,Corvallis,8000,"2009 Mini Cooper Convertible, 1.6L, 4 cylinder, 2 door

It currently has 16,700 miles and that will go up slightly but it's not my daily driver so, not much. It also comes with a service agreement that's good through November 2018 and is still under factory warranty for both bumper to bumper and powertrain (the shocks didn't void the warranty).

I am selling my 2000 Toyota Corolla CE. 

This car is still running fine with 252k miles on it. 


The good:
Has had gaskets done, new suspension on all corners.
Top tier continental tires back in late 2016 I believe. Still lots of life left. Been well maintained, oil changes every 3k Miles. 

The bad:
Needs back brake shoes done. Check engine light on, my mechanic said it was emissions only and doesn't effect drivability, however it won't pass DEQ for this reason (hence why I am selling it in the valley) the car is in Wilsonville (where I live) by I plan on bringing it down to Albany area sometime this week. 

Expired tags.

High miles. 

I've seen these cars have over 300k miles and owners are trying to get over $2,000. Lol. 

With that said, I just don't have the time or resources to fix this. My loss is your gain. 

I feel like it will last another 100k Miles in the right hands.

Automatic transmission with the 302 5.0L V8. 4x4. Here's the rundown:

I traded my car that needed a rebuilt engine for this truck. I wasn't looking for a truck (which is why I'm selling/trading) but couldn't turn down a running vehicle for a non-running one when the trade was offered. 
I was told the 97,000 on the odometer is accurate and it hasn't rolled over, but I have no way to verify. Supposedly was used mainly to tow a pop-up tent trailer.

The good-
*Engine, transmission and 4x4 in great shape. 
*New tires (see pics)
*New deep cycle big boy battery (see pic)
*Bed liner (see pic)
*Dual gas tanks (see pic)
*New plugs, wires, solenoid
*Replaced throttle position sensor yesterday
*Tow package wired for trailer brakes (see pics)
*16 mpg on highway even with V8 thanks to Overdrive 
*Clean interior, seats in good condition in front and back (see pics)
*Highly sought after year/make/model, rarer short bed, extended cab 4x4 combo is hard to find 
*Clean clear title in hand
*Will include pair of steel ramps (see pic)

The bad
*Brake booster and/or master cylinder need replaced (under $150 for parts at autozone, see pics. Even cheaper at pick-a-part). Brakes work, (drove it home) but pedal is stiff, and you can hear vacuum line from failing booster when you press the pedal. Will need addressed, but cheap and easy fix, even if taken to a shop.
*Paint isn't great in a few spots, a couple small dents, but it is a 29 year old truck.
*Left door speaker will need replaced (have a random spare I can include if you want it)
*Not current on registration, last registered through 7/17. Has 30 day trip permit, expired (6/24). Eligible for another permit at DMV though if you don't want to register immediately.

This is a highly sought after truck, you won't find one this year/make/model in this good of running condition for this price, feel free to try. Ford should put them back in production, imo.
All the big stuff (4x4, engine, tranny) is ready to go. Priced for quick sale to get me back into a daily driver. 

If I fix the small stuff it'll be listed for $4875 (NADA mid-range evaluation with all options, see pic) Low end is $2448, get it at a steal before the next guy. This is an awesome truck that will only take a little TLC to make it an amazing truck.
 
No holds, no delivery outside of Lebanon. Trades possible, let me know what you've got. Must be daily driver of equal value, or you add cash on top. Don't need help selling. Cash only, no money order, cashier's check or crypto. Must use CL email relay, unfortunately receive too many scams when listing number, sorry (a few bad apples on here). I will be happy to call or text once I can tell you are a real person who is actually interested.

2000 mustang GT

Buying a house and as much as I don't want to this beauty has to go, need a truck for stuff around the house 


75,000 ORIGINAL miles

Clean title

4.6L, 5 speed Manual transmission

SLP loudmouth 1 resonators less than 2 weeks ago 

Brand new tires less than 2 weeks ago

17"" cobra wheels

I have looked around at these cars the last few months and have watched them sell with 120,000+ miles for $7500, This car is extremely clean inside and out, exterior is 8.5/10 normal wear and tear for an 18 year old car but overall the best condition one I have seen around, few rock chips in the front bumper etc... no major dings or dents. Interior is 9/10 no tears in the seats or cracks in dash. Power seat works perfect AC works perfect everything works. 

The only con on this car is the driver side window motor was replaced by the original owner, while he was doing that he didn't get everything perfect. If you roll the window down all the way it gets stuck on the window guide, you can literally push it with your finger and it rolls right back up. Fully functioning window, I'm sure it's a simple fix I'm just a busy guy. 

I am willing to trade for a few things, a turbo diesel truck, possibly a very nice Tacoma... $8500 cash talks, worst I can say is no if you have an offer. Text  
 with inquiries or questions for the fastest response, thank you!

The car has after market halo lights, an after market exhaust, coil over lowering springs, and a cold air intake. It also has fairly new tires with good tread.

To start off the car does have a salvage title, however there is no frame damage whatsoever with the car and is in mechanically perfect condition.  I would be more then happy to go with you to any body shop to get it checked out.  Just recently I had all the synchros replaced and had a high performance clutch put in.  Smoothest shifting car I have ever driven.  I am selling this car as I have just bought a Toyota Tacoma for my work.  If you have any questions please text or call at  
. I have the carfax upon request. 

The good: 

Recently replaced all synchros in the transmission.

Put in high performance clutch. 

Has beautiful sounding exhaust system with flow master American thunder mufflers, bbk off road x pipe, and cat delete (check engine light occasionally comes on for this reason).

Installed rear window and quarter panel louvers. 

Tint on taillights, headlights, fog lights, and all reflectors.

The beautiful grabber blue color will turn heads anywhere you go. 


The bad: 

Just recently the power seat moves  in every direction but forward, haven't had time to look into the problem but should be a simple fix.

The car could use an alignment/steering wheel centering as the wheel is off about 15 degrees when driving straight. 

Minor scratches on few areas of body. 

Paint is fading on rims and could use a repaint. 

When switching from front facing ac to defrost makes clicking sound due to weak ac actuator, however this is a cheap and simple fix.

The interior is in very good condition and everything functions as expected.  The exterior has typical door dings of a 12 year old car.  This is a super fun car to drive and it has many years of driving left on it.

Great for new drivers that want to learn how to use a manual transmission or anyone looking for an affordable vehicle with good gas millage. 28-35 mpg

The following is a list of all concerns/issues I am aware of with the vehicle. 

Concerns:
-I am an out of state student so the car has Colorado registration/title.
-Some cosmetic damage including light scratches and some front bumper damage. (see images)
-Check engine light is on. The code is P0442 and P0455 EVAP system leak. Typical repairs range $8 to $500 for this issue. 
  I have noticed no issues with gas millage or any running issues other than the check engine light.
- I have dated documentation of these being the only error codes present as of 06/24/2018. 
- Tire pressure dash light is on. This is a faulty sensor or simply needs to be reset. The tire pressure is good and stable. Yes I have documentation dated 06/24/2018 to prove this. 
- The car has had at least one previous owner before me.

Selling my manual Toyota Tacoma pick up with a clean title. I love this shit out of this truck, but unfortunately I have to sell it.

Pretty good aesthetic condition, just a few scratches here and there, and a little bit of pant weathering on the hood and a very small crack in the windshield. Interior is in good condition as well.

Buy this before someone else does. Beautiful Laramie Longhorn SE with matching canopy. This is a special western run numbered 244 of 500. There is no KBB listing on this unit. It is priced now below recommended book price for above average vehicles. This price is firm, I've dropped it down where it is more than reasonable. 

I'm downsizing as my wife won't drive it, says ""we"" need to get something else. There is nothing wrong with it in any way shape or form. I'm the second owner and it's very low miles for a six year old vehicle. I researched the NW, Autotrader, eBay motors, and a lot of other places and there is no rig anywhere that compares with it for any  price. A new one of this class would run over 80K, why buy new? This one has the bugs out of it and runs beautiful. I have a complete vehicle report available with request. It's never been wrecked, use the VIN to run a Carfax if you want but it's explained in the report I've already paid for.

It's a non smoking rig and the interior is like new, full grain leather with Longhorn logos on seats, floor mats, and the saddle bags behind the seats. It is a deep clear coat white with gold accent and trim, and it is custom pinstriped on both truck and canopy with the number on the side. 

As for options, it has every option available plus some aftermarket goodies too. This 5.7 Hemi engine is extremely powerful, I added a Flowmaster exhaust system and a K and N air cleaner, the mileage improved to about 14 city and 19 highway, and also increased the performance. The usual accessories for a luxury rig, PS, PB, 6 way seats, heated seats front and rear, cooled front, pwr windows around, sun roof, adjustable pedals, built in brake system and self leveling system for trailer hauling (it's never hauled heavy), factory installed navigation system, large 8"" screen with GPS, AM/FM/, CD and Sirius XM radio, UConnect, multiple USB ports, 110 outlet, premium Alpine sound system, back up camera and alarm, custom 20"" wheels and good tires, locking lug nuts for theft protection, 6 speed manual/automatic, under seat storage in rear and hidden storage under floor in rear, blown in bedliner, grille guard, bug deflector, and it's regularly maintained, I use Mobile 1 long drain. It was maintained by the dealer for the first year and a half and my local mechanic until now. 

The title is held by Selco Credit Union and any money transfer will be bank to bank for the protection of both parties. Sorry, no PayPal, been there done that, and as stated earlier, no trades. I don't know if I missed anything but if you have questions, drop an email to the g mail place, acrocker38 and I'll try to answer them. This won't last long at this price, be the proud new owner.",1C6RR7PT9DS672873,excellent,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,72521,white,full-size,lien,automatic,pickuphttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2002-suzuki-grand-vitara/6624944909.html,"2002 SUZUKI GRAND VITARA LIMITED,LOW MILES",2002 Suzuki Grand Vitara,Lebanon,3995,"2002 SUZUKI GRAND VITARA

All 4 original hubcaps are there, and tires have good tread. It even has the original green jack stand bag and spare tire, etc. I have a clean title too!

So what's the catch??? Blown motor. This car does not run. I was told the motor was overheated as the previous owner was driving around with the upper radiator hose detached for quite some time. If you have a motor to drop in that's excellent. Likewise, rebuild kits for the engine are less than $300. Also, could be parted out and some money made there as well.

I was hoping to use this in the Gambler 500, but alas, I am not free that weekend!

The good: low miles (for a sub), good tires, clean interior (no big rips or stains), doesn't appear to leak or burn oil, new CV axles, trans fluid looks great and trans work fine, power steering is great, power windows functional, all lighting works; starts, runs, and drives just fine.

The Bad: small exhaust leak, weak battery, missing two hub caps, looks like hell on the outside, ruptured rear brake lines.

For those that know Outbacks, you know that there are plenty of great condition parts on this car. Engine is really in fine shape, and the trans appears to be great as well. Really, the appearance is the most negative thing (a plus in the Gambler 500 though), and the ruptured brake line make driving home dicey. The brakes were fine when I picked it up, and actually ruptured along the way home. Just my luck!

I am the second owner of this 1982 Ford Bronco 4x4 that I have put a lot of work into it. I am moving out of state and unfortunately cannot take it with me. It's a great reliable rig. I've been driving it every day for 6 years to school/ work and back. I typically drive about 5K miles/ year, so it still has low miles on it. Regularly take it in for maintenance, transmission flush, radiator flush, tire rotation, brake fluid, oil change every 3K miles and top it off in between. 

****** Features: ******

302 V8 5.0L Engine, Double barrel carb (I have the original sales receipt from the first owner)

New brake booster & master cylinder 
New front tie rods & alignment

Complete Front brake job, new rear brake cylinders (all bearings packed and greased)

****** It has a few kinks to it: ******

Back window needs a new pin for the electric motor's gear and won't roll down using the switch until it gets fixed (Quoted $100 to fix by a local auto body shop and the motor is fine)

Has been bumped two different times in low-speed fender benders on the passenger side in front of and behind the door. The damage is purely aesthetic and does not affect the performance or function. 

Stereo is a 100-watt amp Pioneer tape deck, tape deck is broken but the radio works great, and I use a radio transmitter to link it to my cell phone for music and navigation.

No AC (The first owner chose to not have one installed. It's fine on hot days when you open the windows/ fins/ and floor vents.)",,good,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,134258,custom,full-size,clean,automatic,truckhttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/cto/d/reliable-commuter-2005-kia/6616631468.html,Reliable Commuter - 2005 Kia Spectra,2005 kia spectra ex,Timberhill,2500,"2005 KIA SPECTRA EX - 158K Miles - Manual Transmission

This is a reliable commuter car in good mechanical condition. I've owned this for 6 years and put 65K miles on it including driving across the state nearly 2 dozen times. It's a comfortable vehicle and I've never been concerned about whether it would start or its reliability while driving. 

Consistent light maintenance has been performed on the vehicle (oil changes, spark plugs, tire changes, replacement of brake pads, lights, wipers, fluid changes etc.) Its largest maintenance job was performed recently: the brake light limit switch was shorted and draining the battery. During the troubleshoot and repair process I replaced the broken switch, battery and alternator (they were getting old), alternator belt, and AC compressor belt. 

You can expect a working, reliable, and relatively fuel-efficient car (~22/30 mpg). There are no serious issues and over the next 50K miles will probably require only minor repairs. 

There are a few known issues. Most of these are either cosmetic or on auxiliary systems. 
- The windshield wiper spray system is not working. This is most likely due to clogged lines or a damaged pump. 
- Light scratches and dents in a few places - hood of the car, rear, etc. 
- The driver-side door must be locked manually. Some of the gears on the door's auto-lock are damaged and make a grinding sound.

It can easily seat 4 or 5 people with a gigantic cargo space in the rear.  I have had it for more than two years and it has never had any major issues. A/C recently fixed and Heat works good. Alternator and battery have been replaced since I have owned it. I bought new tires when I first got it so they have about 54k miles on them. I consider this a truck and not an SUV because it can tow more than 8,000 lbs like a truck. It has automatic 4 wheel drive. The interior is in okay condition with exception of the leather on the drivers seat and some of the fabric on the ceiling is loose.

The mileage reads 354k. My uncle who previously owned it was in the military and drove it back and forth from Georgia to Alabama. I listed the price to reflect that.

Almost every sensor on the engine was replaced. New O2 sensors, crank and cam sensor, map sensor, IACV, TPS, ect. As well as new plugs and coil pack.
The Jeep runs great and is has a small lift on it with new 31 inch Maxxis tires on new Raceline wheels
Has a nice Kenwood headunit with new speakers
Has some surface rust on the hood and roof but nothing crazy
I love this Jeep a lot, but unfortunately it doesn't get driven enough to justify me keeping it so on it goes. 

Does have a rebuilt title and I am unsure of why,

UPDATE!
I just replaced the steering box with a rebuilt one that is stronger (from a Durango), the steering box spacer, and the pitman arm so now the steering is nice and tight!

It is the LT version which includes a few nice options: roof racks, power side door, back up sensor, temp display/compass, more

A few issues are that the AC condenser has a pinhole leak so it will not cool and the drivers side 2nd row captain's chair armrest bolt has stripped out of the chair. Airbag light is on - I am working on fixing that. Driver's seat is power but slow, could just need lube, not sure. Drivers side view mirror power function is down. Does burn a little oil and it does leak a little bit of oil, but not enough to drip on the driveway - has not been  problem for me for the last several years.

It is a great basic car for transportation and hauling you name it. You can take the seats out and put a washer/dryer, fridge, 4x8 plywood in there.

Vehicle Summary:

The 2001 Chevrolet Venture targeted the family transportation market, offering a full-size passenger van with a roomy interior and a range of trims. Buyers could choose from a basic Value Edition, the more upscale LS, the LT, and the high-end Plus. The Warner Brothers Edition, which combined luxury touches with an integrated video entertainment system, was another trim option; the LS, LT, and Plus models were available in both regular and extended-wheelbase versions.

In addition to passenger space and cargo capacity, the '01 Chevy Venture had solidity and power to recommend it. A 4.6-liter V6 engine with 185 horsepower and 210 lb.-ft. of torque gave the 2001 Venture plenty of zip for a larger van. And it did so without sacrificing fuel efficiency entirely: An EPA estimate of 18 mpg city, 25 mpg highway compares favorably to other vans in its class.

Hard to find 3/4 ton Suburban. Pretty much loaded. 8.1L V8
Front row bucket seats. Middle row captains chairs. Third row bench. All leather. Seats seven. Bose stereo with waveguide subwoofer, sunroof, cruise pretty much every option available for that year. 

This thing is born to tow, electric trailer mirrors, four wheel disk brakes, 4:10 gears, engine braking, seven wire towing plug with inertia brake controller and wired to charge. Flow master exhaust with a K&N air filter. 12,000lb towing capacity. 

This thing has been awesome and we love it. It took us two years to find it, and right after we purchased it, we got pregnant with baby number 5. We used it to tow our 20' toyhauler to Suttle Lake last summer and is was an incredible improvement over our previous half ton Suburban (with respect to towing). We have since sold our toyhauler, had baby number 5, and decided that we are not going to tow anything for a couple years. We purchased a full size passenger van and no longer using this Suburban for its intended purpose. 

This thing is a beast and seriously fun to drive. The previous owner was a GM dealership mechanic who took super good care of it. It has a recently (within the last two years) rebuilt transmission and a file folder full of maintenance records. The front seats have been re-upholstered with factory leather and the heating element was replaced on the driver's side. 

That being said, it has a couple of gremlins. 

It is my understanding that all of these things can be traced back to a single item, but I have not replace it. It is called the seat memory module, or something to that effect. 
-The heated seats on the driver's side do not stay on.
-The clock randomly resets.
-The heating and cooling settings for the front are not accurate. (Room temperature seems to equate to about 84 degrees on the setting).
-The windows seem to stop working from time to time. 
Ironically, the two memory positions for the driver's seat, pedals, and mirrors, seem to hold for the most part. 
-At some point, someone struck something with the passenger mirror and the ""up and down"" adjustment does not work remotely. 

Outside of those items, it runs and drives perfect. It does have somewhat knobby tires (that I do not like but my wife loves) that are a bit noisey on the road.

We have road tripped this thing up to Vancouver Island. It is a road warrior for sure. It will not cover ground quite like a half ton, mostly due to the lower gearing, and it does not get fantastic gas mileage, but it has a massive amount of torque, phenomenal passing power, and recognizes no type of topography. Sans trailer, it does not even shift out of overdrive to climb hills at highway speeds. The front suspension is super tight, and it actually handles quite well for something that weighs over 7000 lbs. 

Honestly, its kind of hard to let this thing go, but such is life. We are very aware of how difficult it is to find this particular Suburban configuration, so please don't waste anyone's time with low ball offers. The transaction will take place at my bank as I still owe some money on this fella (I've owned it for just over a year) so that would mean you would need cash or a cashier's check or something to that effect.",,good,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,183000,black,full-size,clean,automatic,SUVhttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2007-mazda-mazda3-touring/6617776174.html,2007 Mazda MAZDA3 i Touring - Local Trade-In,2007 Mazda MAZDA3,corvallis,6995,"SIX MONTH LIMITED POWERTRAIN WARRANTY!

Tyger running boards,Pioneer AVH-2330NEX deck with CarPlay. Look up the specs on the deck. I paid $500 when it came out. So yes, it does most everything. Bluetooth, DVD, etc. Compustar remote start with 2 remotes. Full interior LED upgrade including all 4 door vanity lights. Weathertech floor mats. ARE canopy w/ keys.

Just installed new Bilsteins shocks in the front. Spent $1000 on all new brakes about 4 months ago. Have receipt. I believe the tint is 18% all the way around. Rear parking sensors. Banks exhaust.

Check out our Google Review and see what others are saying about Dan's Automotive.
Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

It will fit your needs for whatever you're doing. Are you a student who needs a cheap reliable ride? Someone who needs a truck for around the farm? Or somebody just looking for a good pickup to haul dirt bikes in or something. This is it. This pickup is very reliable and runs extremely good. It has a brand new alternator. A brand new clutch that was done about 2,000 miles ago. The head gasket was done a year ago and it has nearly brand new tires as well as good tags through July 2019. It also has brand new spark plugs and spark plug wires. Just put bed liner in it as well! 
      The only problems it has are the dings and scrapes of a 23 year old pickup and a small transmission leak. I took it to a shop to get it fixed and the mechanic said to just get the transmission fluid topped off when you get your oil changed and you're good to go!! Come give it a ride. It's a good pickup and it will last you until you get something nicer. Helped me out when I needed a solid ride. Made it even more reliable. And now I am in a better spot and got a new car and it's time for the old pickup to help somebody else. This pickup will not break down on you!!

I am selling my black automatic 1987 Corvette. This muscle car will shake your house while idling outside, but also needs mild restoration so choosing a price is really hard. At the end of the day I need the money so give me your offers.

Pros: The car was built by a previous owner roughly ten years ago, and the fact that it has always been reliable to me is a testament it is done well. I've also done some restoring since I bought the car as it needed it. What exactly is under the valve covers is a bit of a pandora's box but here is my best attempt at a description:
-Complete service history for last 4 years
-1 Year transmission warranty god through 5/2019 from Advance Transmission Service in Eugene. I have this in writing. Transmission went out just recently as they tend to do at 120k but new one works great.
-52mm BBK dual throttle body
-super aggressive cam. See google drive link.
-K&N filter
-Flowmasters
-Cat delete
-Just did rear main seal, car does not leak oil
-All new weatherstripping two years ago, I have been keeping this greased for long life
-New windshield, last one had rock chips
-Updated late C4 wheels
-New rear tires, wont need tires front or back for at least 10k miles

Cons: This car is a ten thousand dollar car, but it just needs work I can't do. This is why it is at the price it is.
-Has a ""ten foot"" paint job. Beautiful blue-black metallic but wasn't clear-coated.
-Had the car parked for three months while waiting for a transmission and now they're really bad.
-Antenna missing since I bought it. Radio still worked fine.
-Had an aftermarket stereo but when I put the stock one back in I must've missed a wire since it doesn't turn on.
-Speedometer screen is burning out.
-Hood scoop had a broken fastener and was loose so I took it off.

Anyway, I wanna be as transparent as possible and make sure both of us are happy with the sale.

Body is near perfect 9\10 but the paint is rough

Interior is super nice except the missing headliner 

I used it as a daily driver for a couple months while I worked on my other vehicle.

To be perfect it needs a couple parts fairly soon.
The front window seals aren't the best, the windshield is cracked, and the brake indicators just started going off.
The speedometer cable could use some lube. 

I'll get around to replacing the parts but the price will go up. 

It doesn't come with the brand new 31 10.5 15's unless I get another $750 they have less than 1k miles on them and I have a buyer lined up for them if they don't sell with the Bronco.

I bought this Firebird last July to go on Hwy 101 down the coast to my aunts who lives in Ventura, CA for my 60th birthday bucket list item: Drive a convertible down Hwy 101. Check. Coincidentally, the guy I bought it from had done the same thing with his wife just a month before me. He bought it from a guy in Bend, OR who had it for most of its life. The tires were checked so I replaced them before my trip and had the air conditioning fixed. Oil change before my trip and even though it's been less than 3000 miles, I'll do a full synthetic oil change again. It is a 5 speed, 6 cylinder engine and drives like a dream. I got 25-29 mpg on my trip. It's a wonderful car, I hate to sell it, but it needs to become someone else's dream car now. It is in Excellent shape and only has 81,750 miles. Yes, you heard me right, only 81,750 miles and counting. I don't know if you know it, but GM 6 cylinders are one of the most reliable engines made. Since it is a 1999, it is also a lot easier to work on if you are so inclined. Don't miss out on this car, reminiscent of the muscle cars of a bygone era. You won't regret it.

I have all records - every detail - since I started driving it with 2 miles on the odometer. 238000 meticulously maintained miles.  I am reluctant to sell this truck as it has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever driven in my 50 years on the road, and it has by far, the best Air Conditioning of ANY vehicle I have ever been in. Runs today as good as the first day I drove it. I have changed the oil over 60 times. Planned on keeping it forever, so I have a pickup load of new in the boxes -parts ($800)for future maintenance IE: Oil filters , front brake discs, front wheel bearings, rear brake shoes, all rear brake parts , windshield wiper motor, set of used 17 inch tires and wheels, and lots more new parts. In the last year (3000 Miles) I have newly installed : Radiator $250, Turn Signal -windshield washer Switch $95, Headlight Switch $53, front Brake Pads $20, 10 ply tires $900, Battery $96 and more. Has lifetime spray in bed liner installed when new  at 200 miles, Transmission Cooler installed at 100 miles, Class IV Hitch Receiver installed when it was a month old. Truck is in good shape with the only body mark is the dent in the passenger door as seen in the pictures. As typical for all the 94 thru 96 trucks the paint started peeling, Once a year I spend a day touching it up. The interior is great, the seats have never been sat on, always had seat covers, ( I rolled them back, to see, in the pictures). Stainless Steel tie downs on the bed. Has some unique Features : I Designed , Fabricated and Installed a Sealed Ram Air , Cold Air Intake with K&N air filter (as seen in the pictures under the front bumper and in the engine compartment) that increased horse power and the mileage range to over 600 miles per tank of gas. Lots more to show off . I would not hesitate to climb in, this morning, and haul a load to Boston and back.  There is gas in the tank.

I bought this about 2 years ago and it had around 120,00 miles on it. I've ran it up to almost 143,00 since then. 

The engine and transmission (5 speed manual) are in good shape and the car runs great. A few months ago I drove it from Texas to Missouri to Oregon without any issues. AC and heater work. Radio and CD player work, and I've got a little bluetooth device in it that lets you connect your phone to the radio - stays with the car. 

Just put 4 brand new tires on the car in January - bought at Costco in Albany. See attached screen shot. Put in a new battery, November 2017. Replaced all spark plugs and a bad engine coil last summer. Had the catalytic converter and O2 sensors replaced almost 2 years ago, so that takes care of the most expensive items that tend to go wrong with these cars. 

No current mechanical issues with the vehicle that I am aware of, but it's a 2002 so little things have to be fixed every now and then. No issues with brakes. The biggest downside to the car is the paint. The person I purchased the car from had a cheap paint job done and it's showing now, flecking off in places. The rear window tint is also bubbling and it makes it difficult to see out of at times. There are small stains in the carpet and on the back seat. Also, it's missing one hubcap. I've attached relevant pictures. 

Bottom line - car runs great, I have the title in hand, and it's a reliable vehicle.

Feel free to come give it a test drive. I'm usually off of work by 5 pm M-F, may be able to meet earlier than that on Tuesday's. Email me from Craigslist or text is fine.

I am selling the listed vehicle for a friend of mine who's father recently died and left vehicle as part of his estate. The current owner has the clear Oregon title in his possession.  Odometer reads 68,726 miles.

 This vehicle is currently not running due to what appears to be an electrical wiring issue plus the ignition switch is missing. In case you are wondering I checked online and you can still buy ignition switches for between $25 - $35 dollars. The owner said the car was last running 2 1/2 years ago.  Other than the electrical issue the car appears to be all there and in really decent shape.

Owned it for around 6 months and planned on keeping it but I had to move in with my grandparents to help take care of them 2 months ago and it's too loud plus I'm looking to save money. 

The title status doesn't change any steps in the process of purchasing, insuring or registering the car. Everything was exactly the same as my previous clean title sedan all the way down to getting the appropriate loan amount. I own the car and have the title in my name.

This car is a great little runner but unfortunately I was told by my mechanic that it has a compression problem. I had a friend look at the car and he said the compression problem could possibly be a head gasket or piston ring burn out. This car had a refurbished Honda engine installed in 2015. Fairly new tires and transmission. Everything else is mostly up to date. This car does burn through oil fairly quickly and just needs oil to be added periodically. Other than a few aesthetic quirks, this little car is great and would be a great project car.

I recently got the front tires rebalanced, but otherwise no service has been done on it while I have owned it. It's had two previous owners before me, and I have only had it for a year, adding ~7000 miles on it. Driving both city and highway has it around 30~mpg (The dash shows both your mpg and how many miles you have until empty), and it has never failed me. 

The SYNC Sound System does Bluetooth, USB, and aux line in. I personally like to charge my iPhone while utilizing the Bluetooth. The outside is a little bit dirty, but overall not in bad shape.

I'm not sure if the paint is original or not, nor am I sure about the vinyl. The paint is flaking (All around the pickup) and there's a noticeable rust spot in the driver-side door. The handle to the driver-side door works but the ""button"" has fallen deeper than it should be resulting in the insertion of your finger to open. The body is straight and I only know of one dent in the pickup that I put there (It's on top of the bed rail, really hard to see in the pictures). Rpm gauge DOES NOT work. Odometer reads 148000 but I'm sure it has rolled over. I'm unaware about the number of owners this pickup has gone through but I can say faithfully that there's two (the previous owner, me). I can provide all previous mechanical work done on the vehicle in my time of ownership. Will not take any offers until after a test drive and/or inspection. Absolutely NO TRADES, cash only.

- 350 v8 
- Holley carb
- 35in BFG mud-terrain tires
- Chevrolet rims

- Pro-Tech tool box
- Flowmaster exhaust (exhaust exit in front of rear tire)

- And more, come by and check it out, it does run and drive.  

Other Stuff (not currently on/in the pickup): 

- 3 extra tires without wheels, one is mud-terrain (Maxxis)

- The original tailgate. I had intended to repaint the tailgate first and fix some things about it (It does take some getting use to opening and closing it but it does open and close) but never got around to it, it's in the same condition as pictured, paint flaking off, some dents

- a box containing the vehicle book (could be original owners manual), another radio, and some other things I'm sure I'm forgetting about",,fair,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,,red,,clean,automatic,pickuphttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2014-nissan-sentra-loaded-r/6605134829.html,2014 NISSAN SENTRA **LOADED ** U-R APPROVED! @ HYLAND AUTO SALES,2014 nissan sentra,www.hylandautosales.com,10995,,,excellent,,,gas,,,,clean,automatic,https://corvallis.craigslist.org/cto/d/nissan-350z-touring-edition/6604650508.html,Nissan 350z Touring Edition,2005 nissan 350z,,6000,"Selling my 350z, looking for a bigger vehicle.

Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

Runs strong and shifts smooth! 4x4 works great hi and lo. Has flow master exhaust, Ken wood stereo and pioneer speakers, 3 rows of seating(holds 8) great for a family or someone who likes more room. Tags are brand new and good thru 2020. Newer tires and brakes too. I've changed the oil every 4K miles with fully synthetic and always maintained it. Ever since the day I bought it one lifter ticks for about 20 seconds then immediately goes away. I've put 57k problem free miles on this car and never touched it.. just let it warm up 20-30 seconds and it's perfect. Really isn't a big deal ask any mechanic it's pretty common actually but you can get it all done for reasonable and have a perfect car. The car is pretty straight but has a few dings and scratches so I'm open to all offers! Thanks for looking. *onky selling because I bought a new truck*

I have babied this car. I searched high and low for it years ago-it was not an easy car to find! Simply needing a rig with more space now. 

I worked for Volvo for a time and this car has received all its routine maintenance along with all major part changes on schedule (timing belt, etc). I had the dual-toned leather seats re-dyed a couple years ago. Had exterior all buffed out about a year ago. Regular detailing. I take very good care of this car, cosmetically and mechanically. I have had all-weather floor mats and trunk mats in this car the entire time I have had it.  

Semi-high miles because I used to have a job where I did a lot of freeway travel. The last couple years have solely used it as a short distance commuter. 

Handles great, truly sporty and such a fun car-I will miss it. Only serious buyers. Please keep in mind this is a rare car and Kelly Blue book does not take into account the availability of any given vehicle on the market.

Comes with good tires.  The only detractor is that the paint has some bubbling over the top but it still shines and looks great, the Speedometer is a little off, and the turn indicator switch needs to be replaced.  Has less than 5,000 miles on it after restoration.  The car drives like a dream and sounds really great with a quiet yet throaty 350 rumble.  I have receipts for around $30k in restoration work.

The car is our current daily driver and mileage will continue to rise as the ad is up. It is Salvage title because of a run in with a deer, no need to worry though because the car won. The car is dependable and reliable, my wife and I have driven it cross country with multiple trips to Iowa and our daily commute from Albany to Salem. Averaging about 34 miles per gallon on I5 going 80, this car has never let us down and promises to deliver a good time. A perfect first car for a new driver, or the perfect commuter car for someone who wants to take advantage of the SYNC audio system. We have the title in hand and are eager to sell.

 You read that right, it's a mother freakin unicorn.  The time has come for me to part with what has been the best car I've ever owned...my 2003 Toyota Camry with a 4 cylinder and a 5 speed manual transmission.

 Does it have a rear view camera?  No.  But it has mirrors and windows and if you open your eyes and turn your head, you can see what's behind it.  I know right?  You might have to roll down the windows because the tint keeps the car cooler than its driver!

 What's the mileage you ask?  It's a Camry.  It doesn't frickin matter what the mileage is!  But if you really want to know, this one's got 224kish on the odometer and they are all PNW miles.  It's mind boggling how many freeways we have and this car has been on every single one of them.  It's seen some beautiful shit out there...and some not so beautiful, but let's not talk about those.  Moving on...

I have kept up with the maintenance as much as I needed to.  There's no timing belt, that's right, this beast has a timing chain.  Built to survive even the crappiest drivers and the zombie apocalypse.  It drinks about a quart of oil every 1000 miles or so but so far, there are no drips in my driveway.  She's a thirsty one, but hey, at least I put the oil in it.  I'm pretty sure the manual lists oil type as, ""optional.""

 This car also comes with the most effective anti theft system on the market today...a clutch.  When thieves are on the prowl they are intrigued by the awesomeness, but then when they see the pedal on the left, they keep on moving to the Honda Civic parked next to it.  They look, but don't touch.  But you?  You can touch all you want if you pay for it!  #ThatsWhatSheSaid

Does it have a clean and clear title?  Yes.  I purchased this BAMF from Beaverton Toyota and paid it off, $200 a month at a time.  It's all mine now; it can be yours for $2900.  If you need to negotiate price, thanks for reading but you're not worthy of owning this fine specimen.  Keep scrolling and find one with a rebuilt title.  No seriously, because they are probably cheaper than this one.  Or maybe look at a Corolla or a 1990 Accord instead?  Both fine vehicles, but this one's better and it's definitely tougher than a Nissan Altima.

 Look, this car screams, ""I'm a practical adult, but still want driving to be fun!""  It's got 4 doors, 5 seat belts, and tons of visual sex appeal.  Except where the cover is missing on the bottom of the front bumper.  You can stick a fog light in there but I leave it empty to remind me just how bad ass this car is.  Yeah, it's missing the cover, but you should see the raccoon...the one I didn't see in the middle of the night running across the road in Eastern Oregon.  I only guess it was a raccoon because I could make a hat out of what was left of it.

Because you twisted my arm, and not because I already have another one, I'll even leave in the stereo system.  It's got an Alpine deck with blue tooth and I also upgraded the speakers.  Will it blow the clothes off your date?  No.  Will you get a ticket for talking on your cell phone while driving?  Also no.  Call it a wash?

Speaking of wash, I just got the car detailed.  Vacuumed and everything.  It's ready for you to do Camry things with it.  Get your groceries?  Okay.  Go on a road trip to Texas?  Sure, why the hell not?  Race a Ferrari?  Hell yes, this one has a clutch pedal, remember?  That shiny new red Italian horse shifts itself...what fun is that?

So why am I selling it?  Because I finally bought the 4runner I always wanted but never needed, thanks to the amazing versatility of the Camry.  Have I mentioned how big the trunk is?  Who's that driver with the junk in the trunk?  It's me!  It's you!  It's your friend who needs to buy a cheap ass car!

Oh yeah, and it's not Beige!  Now shoot me an email with your contact info and let's get this deal done...Your cash for this priceless piece of automotive history: my 2003 Toyota Camry.",JTDBE32K630138494,excellent,4 cylinders,fwd,gas,224000,silver,full-size,clean,manual,sedanhttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/cto/d/2013-jeep-wrangler-rubicon/6579903149.html,2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Unl. 1 Owner,2013 jeep wrangler unlimited,Corvallis,36000,"$36,000/OBO

Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

Check out our Google Review and see what others are saying about Dan's Automotive.
Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

The driver's side power door needs a new wiring harness. The power open works everytime but the power close only works every once in a while. There's slice where it bends and when it's fully extended, it doesn't make contact. Wrecking yard has one and should be an easy swap. 

Has awesome storage with the stow-n-go seating, either have the whole back open, and can lay a mattress down and sleep or carry all kinds of stuff, or put the seats up and have in-floor storage for snacks, toys, or bags that would normally be at your feet. 

As it is 10 years old, it's got some rock chips on the front as does most cars of this age. No real body damage, dents or large scratches, Clean title, kept up on regular maintenance, brakes are due to be done this summer, will do them sooner if someone pays asking price.  ERG valve replaced this winter, and it has a smart sensor that tells your phone average MPG, where you parked, Trip logging (time/date/miles traveled/gas used/estimated cost...etc), and what's wrong if the check engine light comes on.

Overall this is a super comfortable, really clean, good pulling, and good looking pickup that has had regular, proactive maintenance.

This pick-up has power steering, locks, windows, seats and mirrors. The seats are leather and heated they also have a power lumbar support pillow.  The interior is in excellent condition and the air conditioning will make you cold on a hot day.  Cruise control.

Back windows are tinted.  Radio/CD player with 6 CD changer.  Front head-rests have small screens for viewing DVDs in the back seat.  Also has digital programming so you can track average or instantaneous fuel mileage and many other functions.  Has the GM Oil Life Monitor and will tell you when to change engine oil.  Doesn't leak or burn any oil.

Truck has hardly done any towing or hauling.  It was my Dad's before it was ours and he used it as his daily driver and put about 80000 miles on it as a commuter.  GVWR is 9200 lbs. The bed has a spray in liner and a flip up 2 5/16"" gooseneck ball.  Comes with a rigid, folding bed cover. Also has a 16000 lb aftermarket receiver which was installed less than 3000 miles ago.  Comes with a Prodigy 2 electric brake controller to go with the stock tow package.

Wheels are brand new and tires are Michelins with less than 15000 miles on them. Spare tire is brand new.

Transmission was flushed about 4000 miles ago. Injectors were replaced about 20000 miles ago and the brakes are brand new with less than 100 miles on all new rotors and pads.  Alternator has less than 3000 miles on it.  We have receipts for all these maintenance items.  

We really like this pickup and would love to keep it, but we're trying to get started in farming and need to sell it to buy some farm equipment.

A few not so great things: The windshield has a crack which is just out of direct view for the driver.  One of the front head rests is a little messed up on the back side where the DVD screens were installed. The bed cover has some discoloration but it does keep out most of the rain.  One reflector is missing on the inside of one of the back doors.  

This is a really nice four door / quad cab / double cab with one of the best engine and transmission combinations ever put together in a diesel pick up.",,excellent,8 cylinders,4wd,diesel,149021,black,full-size,clean,automatic,pickuphttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2011-ford-350-fx4-super-duty/6612032156.html,2011 Ford F-350 F350 F 350 4X4 Super Duty Lariat 4DR Crew Cab 4x4 Lariat 4dr Cre,2011 FORD F-350,#NAME?,,,1FT8W3BT6BEB21101,,,4wd,other,70216,blue,,clean,automatic,pickuphttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2015-gmc-sierrax4-4wd-truck/6612040014.html,2015 GMC Sierra 1500 4x4 4WD Truck SLT Crew Cab Pickup âœ…,2015 GMC Sierra 1500,((CLICK FOR PRICE)),,"2015Â Â GMCÂ Sierra 1500Â 3675AÂ  Â $39,995 Â Â 3GTU2VEC9FG293736Â Â SLTÂ Â 39,127Â Sonoma Red Metallic / Cocoa/DuneÂ Crew Cab PickupÂ AutomaticÂ D1E43A4A10169351Â 5.3L 8  CylÂ Â Gasoline FuelÂ 4WDÂ 16 City / 22 Hwy

This vehicle was my daily driver, it's an excellent commuter vehicle. I previously commuted from Salem to Hillsboro every day. The condition of the vehicle is fair. I am asking $1,000 OBO.

Pros- The vehicle is reliable and gets around 27 MPG's. It is a five speed, four cylinder, and is a five passenger vehicle. It has a CD player,   Power windows, and cruise control. Maintenance is inexpensive, parts are readily available, and is easy to work on. 

Cons - The interior is stained, exterior has a small dent on the rear driver side door, and the front windshield is cracked. The a/c doesn't work I think it needs a charge and the tires will have to be replaced sometime this year.

It was running reasonably well for a 20 year old car previously. I had it tuned up at Lucky's a few months ago and it was running well, getting me around town and up and down I-5 once or twice a week. 
But then it started and then it died. 

It was having some cranking sluggishness when starting earlier this week. The car turns on but doesn't crank now. Could be a bad battery, could be the alternator, could be the clutch not engaging, could be the starter, could be the battery cables. I don't have the time to figure that out, and I'm through with this car. The inside is a little beat up, but it's not moldy.

Again, this car isn't running; I'm really only interested in serious offers. 
Asking $600.00 -or- OBO.

I'm moving in a few weeks and the vehicle needs to be sold before that happens.

I got my 2002 Kia Rio at the beginning of this year and it has worked great for me. Some things to know: 

1. The car currently has 40,550 miles on it, which is incredibly low for a car from 2002 (A quick Google search says cars are driven on average 15,000 per year). The lady I bought it from had the car for 14 years and said she almost only drove it to work, which was apparently close to her house.

2. It's a stick shift. If you're a younger person like me, this likely means learning how to drive a manual. This would be a fairly good car to learn on since the clutch seems pretty forgiving, but don't really know how new manual cars compare since I haven't driven one and they aren't really made much anymore. If you have no clue or need a few pointers on how to drive a stick shift, I would be happy to help. 

3. If you look online for the mpg, google will tell you it gets 27-city and 32-highway, which has been accurate for this car in my experience, one time I got around 25 on the highway but I was going around 85 on I5 so that's pretty reasonable. 

4. I'm still using the car, and am thinking it would be helpful for moving out of my apartment, which I will be doing on the 15th of June. However, if you want to purchase the car before then, I can make it work, just give me some heads up so I can get it all cleaned up. 

5. All the windows and doors are manual. This can be a pain, but at least you don't need to worry about them breaking. 

6. I got new tags this year which cost a bit (112$ if I remember right) so you won't need to worry about that.

Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

It has 3:73 gears with the rear a full floater and I have the brackets and some other parts to put disc brakes on the rear.  I also have put new shocks and new steering stabilizers on it.  It has a 4"" lift.  The interior is in good shape and it has the third row seat.  It has the barn style doors as you can see in the pictures.  The transmission is a TH400.
The headliner was sagging so I pulled it out and put the trim back in and it looks fine.  It will need new tires.  I have not charged the AC, but we live in Oregon so I  just opened the wing windows.  It's not perfect but it runs and drives great.  I have taken it to eastern OR a few times with no issues at all.

Very clean and outstanding mileage (38+ if you keep your lead foot out of it. Car will do 130+ MPH). Leather interior and EVERYTHING works. The only problem is the LCD for the Stereo. Stereo works but the LCD does not. No leaks in sunroof. Outstanding car for its age and mileage.

Awesome black & white VW Bug. Started rebuilding this Baja Bug, but too many projects invoke review of priorities & preferences. We're moving next year and can't take it with us and we'd also like to use the funds to take a vacation this fall. So I thought the project better suited to someone who could put the cosmetics in their own style. (I thought of mounting a giant treasure chest on the back, but again, the new owner will find their own taste.)

Could be a lot of fun for anyone, but especially so for someone who loves the pirate theme and there are plenty of them in Oregon! If you like/would like to attend Pirate festivals such as Sea Dog Nights, Port Royal Sanctuary, Tortuga, Annual Pirate Party at Depoe Bay, Pirate Festivals at Rockaway Beach or Tillamook Coast, and Pirates of the Pacific at Brookings, this is the perfect project for you! Gotta love the antenna flying the jolly roger! Personalized license plate even says AARRR !!!!!

No extreme low balling or asking to make payments as those emails will simply be deleted. Partial trades considered if you have a used Cushman truck or something similar. No OMMP trade offers please. Let me know what you have to offer by responding through CL email. Serious buyers only!

But this thing cranks right up every time and still rides smooth. Selling because we got a newer car and don't need three vehicles. This car is perfect for a college student. The broken stuff can easily be fixed or just lived with. It'll get you from A to B.

The good: 
Clutch, tires, tranny, engine runs great. Interior in great shape, no rips or tears. 

The bad:
Slow leak in radiator, needs fluid every 1000 miles or so. Dings all over, paint fading in places. 

The ugly: 
Driver side handle isn't functional on the inside, and the power window motor is shot, so the window is rigged closed and the door won't open from the inside. To get out, I pop open the back door and reach around and open the driver door from the outside, but my wife can't reach so when she drives it she has to climb out on the passenger side.

That's the worst issue as far as daily use. Window motors are under $50 online, but I don't have the time to mess with it, and that would be stretching my mechanical aptitude anyway.

the paint is starting to peal but the body it self is straight, as far as i know never in any fender benders much less wrecks

s5 turbo street ported block (irons,housings,rotors) along with s5 accessories like manifolds, turbo, injectors and rails, electronics/sensors. 5 lug, sun roof, aero mirrors, spoiler. has a new wide band and boost gauge along with a walbro 255, front mount with hks blow off valve, rear n370 ecu

interior is in pretty good shape, needs some work, the biggest issue is going to be a tear on the driver side seat. steering colum plastics will need to be reassembled but they are all there. 

as far as price goes i would like to see what kind of offers i can get $$$ no rush to get ride of it, just trying to decide if i should keep and build or go a different way. im sure im forgetting some info about the car...

Pros: Brand new tires, Brand new battery, and new throttle body/ sensor. The interior is in great shape, aside from the driver seat which has an appropriate amount of wear in it for a 2005(pics inserted) Handles great, it has the turbo and it gets great gas mileage. Great car, starts up every time, ac blows cold and heater blows hott! The body is in great shape aside from a small dent (pic inserted) in the front quarter panel.

Cons: There is a faint shake that can be felt when pushing on the gas peddle above the speed of about 30 mph. Since this car rides so smooth and the shaking only occurs while applying pressure to gas pedal, id assume it is some sort of sensor not a suspension issue. 

My lose is your gain!

Price reduced,1996 Ford Explorer Xlt,corvallis,1400,"ive owned this good old ford for a couple years now, and its been a great car. as far as SUV's go this year of explorer is great around turns and windy roads, never got a tippy feeling from it. it has a clean title, and as well it has 268,xxx on the motor and chassis, and 130,xxx miles on the transmission. the transmission was replaced when it was at 160,000, with a transmission that had 25,000 miles on it. the transmission is CLEAN and you can feel it when you drive. no lag, no slip, always knows what gear it needs to be in. the motor is still going strong, and i have always kept the oil good. starts up great and the heater and a/c work, but the ac usually needs for you to drive around for it to start getting very cold. cruise control works, and the easy switch between 4wd low and 4wd auto and 2wd is operating smoothly. there is a small panel window taken out, i was quoted 75$ for the glass awhile back. also doesnt have a stereo installed, but i have a new bluetooth one right here and i might get around to installing it before it sells and if not will include it. Has the sun roof, which works without issue.

overall a trustworthy rig, that has never left me stranded and never made me wish i had another car. it has some miles on the motor, but has been taken care of. And the transmission is good, which is a big factor. will be a great car for whoever decides to come take a look! has a clean title and tags are good until july.

Check out our Google Review and see what others are saying about Dan's Automotive.
Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

It does have some leaks but anyone who knows jeeps knows they are known for that. It does need so new breaks I believe and new tires and we just don't have the extra time or money like we originally thought we did.

They Did not sell well Because  they were  $15,000 more than a Chevy or ford crew cab at that time.  I have been told that there was anywhere between 6 to 80 of these out there.   I have not been able to verify that.  I Believe the fabricator was Carl Green.  I have included a picture of what we believe is the truck during the customization phase. I am not saying that this is the truck but we believe that it very well could be. 

 Truck originally came with a V 10. When I bought it, it had the 215 P pump Cummins 12 valve engine with an automatic. We switched over to the six speed manual.  

96 12 valve with 215 p-pump

05 nv 5600 6 speed with 271 transfer case

22.5 Alcoa aluminum rims with space adapters with double coin tires

4"" tough country lift with custom ladder bars

06 double caliper piston brakes in the front

2012 steering 

02 Dana 60 front end (rebuilt in 2016) and Dana 80rear  with 4:11 gears

99 electronics and dash with heated seats and 5 additional 12v power supplies

2012 front bumper with fog lights

Upgraded tow mirrors with defrost 

Isopro gauges: turbo, barometer, fuel  

Custom glass and door panels for rear doors

Custom upholstered inserts for front door panels

Upgraded alpine stereo with 6 speakers, Maybe 8

4"" exhaust

Protech toolbox and headache rack

Panasonic DVD player (no sound through stereo.  Needs compatible headphones)

Arma coating bed liner

Custom truck bumper on rear

Needs: windshield wiper motor as it's blowing the fuses.  E Brake light is constantly on in the dash.  Occasionally if you get on it, the clutch slips.  New clutch when we changed over to the six speed in 2015. . However, we should  have gotten a more powerful clutch as there is more power than what the stock clutch can handle.  There are some cracks in the Dash but currently there is a cover over it. It is just a plastic molded cover. The truck is currently being used on and off for some work projects but for the most part it sits. 

I do not know of any rust. The paint is worn on the hood. It may be worn on top of the truck cab as well. The bed was replaced and the color is just a little bit different silver than the cab. The interior was switched over to a 99 interior rather than the older 95 style. Custom panels were made for the rear doors to closely match that of the front. Electric switches were put from a Durango of a similar year for the rear doors and the main control panel switch at the drivers door. There is a crack in one of the plastic dully fenders. We have two extra dully fenders from the original bed.

This is a project truck we've been working on for several years so it has a few things to do still. It has been used as a work truck and is no way in a show condition.",1B7MF36W7SS22338,good,,4wd,diesel,246000,grey,full-size,clean,manual,truckhttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2015-chevrolet-equinox-lt-awd/6617939776.html,2015 Chevrolet Equinox LT AWD - One Owner!,2015 Chevrolet Equinox,corvallis,16995,"REMAINING FACTORY WARRANTY!

Glass is all there and not cracked but needs new window seals everywhere.  Interior is all there as well.  Good enough for a driver but needs refreshing with new carpet and seat covers.  Headliner is good.  Rear seat folds to make a bed platform in the back.

I owe about $19,000 on the car and am half way through a 5 year loan. This is a great opportunity as you will have less interest and be able to pay off the car in 2.5 years. Otherwise, it's $21,500 - we will handle the transaction at a local bank.

Wife going back to school soon so need to pickup a cheap, economical car. This thing is incredible for the price. It's perhaps the most desirable configuration for the E92. Alpine white. Black Dakota leather interior with brushed aluminum trim. LED Halo lights. M-Sport package comes with badges, shadow trim and aero of the body, lowered from factory, sport tune and M-Sport suspension. It drives much better than a standard 3 series. Nice 19"" wheels as well. I also have new max performance summer tires installed with only 6,000 miles on them! You'll find others that just don't add up like this, like that ugly wood trim, weird color or no M-sport package which makes a HUGE difference in the look and feel of the car. 0-60 in 4.6 -300HP/300tq stock.

Before the warranty expired I had the windshield molding replaced, service done and O2 sensor replaced by dealer. After that I replaced the water pump and thermostat with brand new OEM parts. I can get the receipts. Also recently replaced the Coolant expansion tank. All the little things that break on these cars I've replaced already and are basically brand new. Oil change was at reputable indie shop using BMW approved LL oil (Motul) -which I can also get receipt for. Last oil change about 2000 miles ago I did myself with a BMW oil kit (BMW OEM oil and filter)

New top of the line performance tires installed about 6k miles ago. They are Continental Extreme Contact Sport - a brand new tire they just released. They have 90%+ tread left on them. These are direct competitors to the Michelin PSS and their new tire. They grip for days. I don't think there's a better tire for this car.

There are some minor scrapes and such like with most used cars. Of note are a small line on driver side door about 1/4"" long, very tiny. A couple black scuffs that can be buffed out, also very small. Some curb rash on the wheels (from original lessee) and scuffs on under part of front bumper. Nothing that can really be noticed unless looked for and very close up. Also rear middle seat headrest seam has torn from the heat last summer. It's not a big deal but is there nonetheless. I have been using 303 protector and Lexol on the interior since I got the car about 2 years ago. Also wash at home with Maguires gold car wash and wax with Maguires pure Carnauba wax. Overall the car is in great condition for the miles and age. However, it was in a minor accident before I purchased it. No airbags deployed. The title is still clean.

*Note that this is the N55 engine model. The 2011 and previous e92's used the N54 engine. The N55 is a great engine and is reliable compared to the N54. The N55 uses a single twin-scroll turbo while the N54 uses twin turbos that have been known to cause issues.The N55 is a very solid motor and is one of BMW's most reliable to date. It is wroth the premium IMO to get the newer N55 engine models. They have been used since 2011 and in many of BMW's performance cars. The M3 and M1 used the S55 (variant) engine. The N55 get's up to 15% better gas mileage, has better low torque response and throttle response and better reliability as compared to the N54. The N55 engine made the ""Ward's"" list of ""top 10 best engines"" from 2011-2013 All the info is on the web, just do a google search.

I am the second owner, and purchased it from my neighbor after graduating high school to use during college. He was a mechanic commuting 1.5 hours/day, and put the first 195,000 on the car. He personally performed all preventative maintenance on the vehicle himself, including a belt replacement around 190,000. Now I'm looking for something a little bigger considering I will not be commuting anymore. 

-Clean title
-Manual transmission with which I've never had issues. Still shifts smoothly.
-222000 miles, almost all highway
-Last oil change at 220,000 miles
-Battery replaced last year
-Tires have good tread, and were purchased last year at around 210,000 miles. 
-Automatic door locks and windows
-Plain interior, with gray cloth seats/panels and black dash. Interior is in good condition, and was recently detailed. Neither owner smoked in or abused the car. 
-Most recently got 46 mpg on a trip to California, driving conservatively

This car is and will continue to be a wonderful commuter. In the three years I've owned it, I've only had to replace the battery and tires, while getting 43+ MPG the entire time. That being said, the check engine light has been on for the past year, coding for an EGR issue - luckily, the EGR has to do with the exhaust, and does not affect the engine's functionality in any way.

Mechanic who would be so kind as to helpful me put the remaining parts nd pieces of my cars timing belt assembly and such back together, as well as help me figure out why its leaking oils, and running a little weird. I had a friend help me replace it and he did a real sloppy job.. he rushed putting it back together took short cuts and such.
The timing belt is on but the other tgree serpentine belts are hanging. It looks like it just needs the upper part of the timing cover put on, and a few random bolts and screws put in as well. Im also hoping we can look over his work and find any additional errrors he made as to prevent my car from addtional problems down then line. Id also like help deciding if the motor was damaged when the belt broke. I did have him check the compression and he said it was good, but I wasnt there so I dont know how much of that is valid. Ive only reciently, this last year, started to learn how to work on cars, but being a women, I tend to not have the strength needed for most of the mechanical work. Tough as it has been I refuse to give up I just need someone knowledgeable and kind enough to help me. Im currently in corvallis as is my car.. I could pay for the help, but not very much.

Pontiac had record of selling 211. This car sold for $18,500 in 86. It was a no option car, came fully loaded and only in silver. The car came stock with a 305 V8 and a 4 speed auto transmission. 

 It ran fine till the computer crashed. I then pulled the intake and smog off the car and ran an old school intake and 4 bbl. It ran great but the transmission now wasn't getting signal to shift properly. I pulled the original engine and transmission and have stored indoors. Plan was to install a 4 bolt 350 and TH 350 transmission from a 70's pu. (needs output shaft swapped to a short shaft). Or shorten and balance the shaft?  Or be unoriginal and do an LS1 swap. I am the third owner and have had it for 13 years.

 All original engine parts / transmission come with this car, as do the 4 bolt 350 and Th 350 if desired.

 Interior has seen better days carpet and back seat are missing, console broken, misc damage on door panels. 
 
 Back window leaks at the top right, creating a rust stain at back seat. I think someone did repair before i got it.
 
 Body is solid with no rust to my knowledge, huge doors so hinges need new pins. Trunk lid is fiberglass, nose is plastic. 
Car needs paint. 
 
 Two sets of wheels, original 15"" rallys no tires and 88 Monty Carlo SS 15"" aluminum alloys on the car.


 This car has American History, that is as rare as the car itself. Designed to be more aero and raced only one season by few including Richard Petty (The King).

It's a 5 speed manual.
Runs and drives exactly how it should without any fluid leaks. Body could use some cleaning up, but there aren't any leaks in the hardtop or other seals.
The 4.0 HO swap was done by the previous owner who was an independent mechanic. 
Has 4WD in 4-Hi and 4-Lo

Asking $7500 OBO or trade. Shoot me an offer, least I can say is no.

Recent Service(within last 500 miles):

- Oil change
-Valve cover gasket (notorious issue with the 4.0)
-Thermostat
-Thermostat housing gasket
-Steering stabilizer

Stuff:

- NP231 transfer mated to a AX15 transmission (will include spare NP242 transfer case)
- 2.5inch lift
- AWC 15x8.0 wheels wrapped in 31.0x10.5 tires with lots of life (matching spare 5th wheel included, it just doesn't have a tire on it)
- Locking lugs
- Hard-top with tinted windows
- Aftermarket speaker system with amp and sub. It's very loud and crisp
- Red Optima battery
- Auxiliary light front and rear

Cons:

- Passenger side outter tie-rod should be replaced soon, I'll probably get it taken of soon
-Some cosmetics

Will add more photos later this week

This has been the most reliable vehicle I've ever owned. It has NEVER failed to start up and get me where I needed to go, pavement or otherwise. If you're looking for a decently sorted jeep that can go anywhere and do what you need it to, this is it. 
Again, asking $7500 OBO or trade. Shoot me an offer, least I can say is no.
Text or email at any time of day, I'll get back to you as quickly as possible. Thanks

Great for daily driving.

I installed sport seats and removed the spoiler. Tires have decent life to them still.

It's an OSU Orange Smart ForTwo.  This little car is a blast to drive, and honestly, I want to keep it, but we don't need an extra car.  

While it is the ""Pure"" model it does have the heated seats and automatic windshield wipers, and manual mode for the transmission.

At only 22k miles this thing runs like new.  It was recently serviced at the Smart Center in Portland.

It has a really stout locking bike rack.  The bike rack is easy to remove (two bolts and it's off).

Anyways, as much as I hate to part with it, it's time.  Currently it's financed at SELCO so if you need to finance it, if you go with them it's a piece of cake as they can just copy all the info over from when we applied.  SELCO is pretty generous about loans as well. 

Give me a call or a txt come see the car and take it for a spin.  

Currently we're asking $8500 due to the low miles, but we will entertain other reasonable offers if we don't sell it soon.

Some quick facts.

It is gas, not electric.
It goes fast (Top speed is 100mph+)
Gas Mileage is about 35MPG in town or on the Highway.
It has a whopping 8 airbags and a steel roll cage, it is extremely safe. Here is the record from the IIHS for the Smart ForTwo - http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/smart/fortwo-2-door-hatchback/2014
It's bigger on the inside than the out (like a Tardis).  I'm 6' 4"" and drive it to Portland regularly.

I purchased the truck three years ago and since then have made some major changes to it. For one, I had the brake system almost entirely redone with new lines in places, a new master cylinder, and new drums and discs. A completely custom 3 3/4"" exhaust system installed by high performance racing in Southern California leading to exhaust tips the same size. The engine was also replaced 3 years ago, when I took the .390 out and put in a .460. Now with under 10k miles on it, it sits with an MSD distributor and ignition setup and almost every new part in between. I have documentation for all of the parts that have been added or replaced over the years, so I can provide as much proof as needed. The radiator, steering column, and spark plug were all replaced a month ago, and the truck is in great running condition. I often joke that the only things that aren't new on the car are the drive shaft, the tranny, and the driver himself. There is well over 10 thousand dollars in this truck and has been treated right. The truck runs and looks great aside from one minor blemish on the passenger side (which I included a picture of), and deserves to go to someone who will really care for it. 

Let me know if you have any more question,

Has a cord for older style ipod hookup, though you could easily buy an attachment for newer generations. Has semi new break pads and new fuel pump [with in the last year].

 The ac works, just needs recharged. And the arm rest on the front passenger door broke off due to old plastic. I've searched wrecking yards for an arm rest or new panel but no luck for manual doors. 

It also comes with 4 studded tires used a couple times by previous owner[NOT on rims, which is why I never used them] has clean title.

Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

I have worked on this truck for 6 months. I can get it to run on starting fluid but it won't stay running. The gas tank was taken out and the fuel pump was tested with nothing wrong with the fuel pump. Come to find out there was a short in the ECM1 (electronic control module 1) and it was blowing fuses in the dash panel.

I am through tinkering with it. My loss is your gain!

RELIABLE Just drove from LA California Practically to Albany OR it was great ride I would do it again no problems at all I think this can get to 360k-380k or more if taken care of. I drove just about 15 hours or so and only took just a little over 2 full tanks of gas. like 120$ it was surprisingly good!

This vehicle had 1 owner before me a few months ago, I probably handled it worst then her TBH super well maintained


Cons:

NO A/C SORRY
NO RADIO
NOT 4X4 it is a 2wd
Needs new windshieldwiper blades
Back right passenger window will not roll up or down (it is currently slightly open)
Belt screeches SOMETIMES when I start it, even though it was replaced idk why it does it sometimes it doesnt and if it does its only for a second
Little creaking when turning not bad
Soda Stains in the back from Recycling Cans
I drove my dog around in it so if allergic I couldnt get all the hair should get a pro clean

Again, I have taken exceptional care of this truck.  The only reason that we are selling is that we are in the process of purchasing a new 2018 Ford and I do not need two :-).  This truck is amazing, has everything you could ask for on a truck and looks amazing.  The only thing that is wrong with it is there are two pieces of molding on both sides that are losing their platinum tri-coat color and there is also a small scratch on the driver side bed (see picture).  It has never been in any type of accident (see car fax) and again is in excellent condition.  I have all of the maintenance records for every single thing that has been done on it since we bought it new.  Kelly Blue Book and Carfax have it listed at $44,570 but that amount does not include all of the added items that are listed above.  If you add that in along with the KBB and Carfax price, you get $50,9240.00.  

Give me a call, text, or email if you are interested.  $46,500.00 OBO.

Additionally, if you are looking for a truck that comes with the Fifth Wheel Hitch, the Hitch that I have for this truck is a ""SuperGlide PullRite"" Model 4400 that can pull up to 20,000 lbs.  Brand new purchase price is $1,400.00.  This hitch is designed for short bed trucks.  Most fifth wheel hitches require that you exit the vehicle and pull the lever when attempting to make a sharp turn with your trailer.  The allows the trailer to move back so you do not impact the rear of the truck.  The SuperGlide is an auto adjusted hitch that automatically moves when needed.  It is amazing and works exactly as described.  I would be willing to let it go with the truck for an additional $1,000.00.  Another great thing about this hitch is that once you are done pulling the trailer, you can easily remove the hitch and the brackets without any tools.  It comes right out, and posts come out and you have the bed of the truck back.",1FT7W2BT0EEA16032,excellent,8 cylinders,4wd,diesel,677944,white,full-size,lien,automatic,truckhttps://corvallis.craigslist.org/cto/d/2016-jeep-4x4-patriot/6624552275.html,2016 jeep 4x4 patriot,2016 jeep patriot sport 4wd,junction city,18500,"very low miles on like new. 2016 jeep patriot 4 wheel drive, high altitude edition.black leather seats. exterior silver,  power moon roof, high in entertainment center, gps, back up camera, cd, dvd player. only about 17000 miles, one owner, phone",,like new,,4wd,gas,17000,silver,mid-size,clean,automatic,https://corvallis.craigslist.org/cto/d/1999-gmc-1500-suburban-4x4-slt/6624513656.html,1999 GMC 1500 Suburban 4x4 SLT,1999 GMC Suburban 1500 4x4,Corvallis,4500,"1999 GMC Suburban 4x4 SLT in excellent condition.

Here is an Example:
Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

Asking 4500 OBO 

Willing to trade for decent Quads 

Here's the good
1999 Chevrolet Suburban
113K miles
350 V8 Gas Engine - AUTO
4x4
Power windows - all work
Power seats - work
Power mirrors - don't work
Cloth interior - no tears or bad wear on seats
Its in decent shape for a 1999 vehicle
Motor is strong and runs great
4x4 works but we never use it
Tires are almost new, maybe have 5K miles on them, we purchased them a few years ago but hardly drive the truck.

Here's the things that don't work
Gas Gage has never worked since we bought it, we re-set the mileage tracker to 0 every-time we fill it and run it to 350 - 375 miles and then fill it up and re-set the tracker and have never had any problems

The AC needs re-charged - we hardly drove it so we did'nt really need the AC
Heater blows great but the fan only seems to work on High 

Interior is in decent shape for as old as it is, no tears or heavy wear on any of the seats, the rear portion was used to haul things in it so the carpet is a little dirty and worn.

The front side speakers have some rust on the factory grill

Other than that, the vehicle has always turned right over and ran great the entire time we've owned it.

Pros;
1) It starts and runs.

4) Good MPG (25+)
5) Siped Les Schwab tires with ~ 50%tread on them
6) Clutch replaced 1.5 years ago

Cons;
1) Check engine light on
A) Code P0016 displays on the dash(P0016 - Crankshaft Position - Camshaft Position Correlation (Bank 1 Sensor A)) (cam shaft
position sensor and crank shaft position sensor have been replaced, that turned the light off for approximately two months)
a) https://www.obd-codes.com/p0016
2)Oil light comes on after driving for a short while (I haven't been able to figure this one out, it doesn't overheat)
3) Minor body damage / minor interior trim damage
4) Turn signal works intermittently
5) Engine sound (knocking noise)
6) CD's don't always eject properly
7) Dogs were often in this car (dog hair carwash vacuum wouldn't remove, water spots on front passenger seat)
8) Unseated spark plug barrel in two middle cylinders (they rise up occasionally and a little oil is lost due to this)

I have been using this car to commute to and from work for five years. It has been a reliable car. I'm selling it because I recently purchased a newer model. Would be a great car for someone making short trips (student, local) or you could turn it into a mobile sound system for tailgating. Please read whole list and feel free to ask questions. $750 OBO.

For you ""Saab people"", you understand the Saab driving experience and this Pearl White car is in excellent condition and is truly an eye-catching machine.  Saab is well known for its incredible handling which is unbelievable, and the turbo delivers power instantly when it is asked for. It corners like a dream, climbs hills with ease and passes with plenty of power; all while getting 27-35 mpg.  As I said, the paint is Pearl White and is in beautiful condition. Interior is a 9 out of 10. Leather seats and interior, carpets etc show very little wear. The climate control system is perfect...Air conditioning system was completely replaced last September and blows cold and the heater blows hot.  Power windows, power seats, mirrors all work perfectly. Tires are in excellent condition. Cruise control, heated seats, traction control all perfect condition.  AM/FM/CD sound is original equipment. Electric controls for the top work as they should. Back window is clear. Car has no mechanical problems whatsoever. 5 speed manual transmission gives the driver complete control over the vehicle, shifts perfectly. Instruments all function properly. Turbo functions fantastically and does not smoke even a tiny bit. Has very low miles and should easily be good for another 150,000 or more. Includes car cover and wind screen (which reduces the air blowing things around when the convertible top is down. It is visible in one of the photos).

I am selling this car because first of all I have too many cars and secondly I do not drive this one enough (have garaged it during the winter months). I will eventually be looking for the slightly larger 9-5 sedan to replace this car. I have owned several Saab's, including a 1989 900 convertible, a '95 9000 (which I sold after it reached 300,000 miles) and a 2002 9-5. This is truly a beautiful car, the nicest Saab I have owned. 

Consider this Saab, which is similar to BMW, Mercedes in style and handling, but costs thousands less. Call or text.

in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

AC blows cold... starts every time... gets good gas mileage if you stay out of the SuperCharger, and it's taken us on many adventures.

Now though... We've become old folks with a new Buick, and the GP needs a good home.  I'll listen to realistic offers, but I don't HAVE to sell the car and am not interested in somebody coming to look at it and picking it apart.  IT has flaws... it's not new.

I absolutely love this car and don't want to sell it but due to financial reasons I've got to. It's a Honda so it runs like a champ and will run for tens of thousands more miles. Grey upholstery interior, not in perfect shape as it's been a family car for us for years but it's in fine condition. It has 177k miles on it and a rebuilt title from an accident it was in before I got it but I've never had any issues with it due to that. Runs and starts strong and has always been reliable for us. It does have a leak in the power steering system but I don't have the money to fix it. Still runs fine I just make sure to keep the fluid level full. 
Let me know if you want to come check it out or have anymore questions. It's a great car and someone who has money to maintain it will be very happy with it!

Protech headache rack and toolbox also is newer. Motor is stock, I had the head pressure tested and resurfaced when head gasket was replace along with new valves, guides, and springs. I have a lot of time and money into this truck and it shows. Definitely one of the nicest on craigslist. This truck has it all. It gets great gas mileage as in I drive it daily. Has a flowmater 40 that sounds mean. It's got a few dings and such, I treat this thing like a pavement princess. CLEAN TITLE!!! Pictures don't do justice. Looking for 7500$ OBO or trade for a toy hauler, side by side I can put cash on top also. Or maybe a built 450 or banshee. Or even a nice open bow boat.

Unfortunately, we just don't use it and it has basically sat for the last 5 years with little use.   I've been wanting to use the motor in something else but that something else hasn't come along so I'm selling the whole business. The truck sends me straight from 6 to midnight every time I drive it, but I need to finish school more than I need the truck.  The truck is already experiencing some age issues which I've listed below.     It has a new Optima battery and fires right up and runs smooth.     The steering is nice and tight and goes down the road well.       Tags are good through 2018.   

BODY & CHASSIS: ---Factory 4x4 4speed -- it's not a hacked together jacked up truck
 -     1-ton  ( K30 )  3+3 cab
 -     4-wheel drive 4x4 works.   Heavy duty manual locking hubs. 
 -     4-speed manual transmission

 -     Positrack rear end with 3.73 gear ratio
 -     Bedliner
 -     Aluminum diamond plate toolbox
 -     Hella H4 & H1 headlights with 100 watt bulbs & separate wiring.    These are expensive lights and light up the road.       Two aircraft landing lights are mounted on bumper and are relayed off high beams.   Road signs will blind you.
 -     Rear backup lights on separate switch
 -     Hella air horns
 -     Rear brakes rebuilt with new brake shoes, wheel cylinders, axle seals. Fresh oil as well

ENGINE:
 -     383 cu-in small block stroker  (350 bored 0.030 over with 400 crank)
 -     Engine balanced, very smooth
 -     Forged pistons 10.2:1
 -     Dart-II heads with the big 2.02"" valves
 -     Hooker Headers
 -     Edelbrock intake
 -     Edelbrock carburetor with electric choke
 -     Clutch and flywheel have less than 10k miles on them.
 -     Newish Optima battery
 -     Dual 2.5"" exhaust with Magna flow mufflers.    VERY nice exhaust note, no exhaust leaks.
 -     Big radiator from a diesel pickup.
 -     New starter

INTERIOR:
 -     Pioneer stereo with 4 sets of speakers front rear + subwoofer (not currently wired because I took the amp)
 -     Seats & headliner reupholstered about 10 years ago.    Driver's side seat is starting to fray
 -     CB radio with magnetic antenna. Very fun on I5
 -     Carpet dirty.   Was replaced in about 2008, so it should clean up well.   It isn't very worn. 
 -     Nice high-end floor mats in front.

ISSUES:
 -     Window felt and door seals are old and should be replaced.   It has a fair amount of wind noise going down the road.
 -     Some rust forming in rocker panels by door.   
 -     It is generally a noisy truck.
 -     Interior kinda dirty.   Sorry, I'm not vacuuming.
 -     some rust forming on top of cab.
 -     speedometer needle bounces around some - have replacement speedometer assembly
 -     master cylinder seems to have a slight leak
 -     paint is pretty scuffed on the bed rails but is an easy fix

PRICE:  $7,500  .

It is on its third clutch, which was replaced within the past 50,000 miles. I just put two new tires on it and had the oil changed at the end of March. The past owner and I have always kept up on routine maintenance. The ignition coil, timing belt, water pump, head gasket, and hoses have all been replaced within the last 50,000 miles. There are no leaks, oil or otherwise.
It has an aftermarket stereo and suspension (it is lowered). The battery was wired to the trunk of the car. Needs a new catalytic converter.

Maybe you are tired of being shoehorned into an econobox with barely room for a friend and barely enough trunk space for a box of Kleenex?

The Cadillac Brougham is the pinnacle of automobile excellence. It floats down the highway and coddles it's occupants in the warm embrace of leather. This car was produced during a time when Cadillac was proud of their product; adorning practically every surface with it's crest...from the ignition key to the door lights. These cars retailed at over $40,000 in 1990!

This Caddy has been my parents pride and joy for decades and has been diligently maintained. Don't be afraid of the mileage because we've maintained it in tip top running and driving condition. The paint is showing some wear and the front seats have tears but this car still catches eyes wherever it goes. Be prepared to be stopped on the street by admirers and find notes under your windshield asking if you want to sell.

I've included many photos and tried to highlight the worst area of the car so there's no disappointments. We would love to keep this gem but it's now time to downsize. I'd have no hesitation in firing up this Caddy and driving to Vegas right now. Fuel mileage is surprisingly good, averaging about 18mpg.

I have had this car for a little over a year now and it has served me well. I'm moving into a new car so my civic has to go. Let me show you all the good stuff.

This is about as basic as you can get. Small 4 cylinder Automatic Four Door Sedan. It's a 1998 that only has 143,000 miles on it! It's got a LOT of life ahead. It's easy to drive and get terrific gas mileage (for a gas car) at 25 MPG in city and 33 MPG Highway. It's got Power Windows, Cruise Control, and AC! Great Starter Car or Cheap Daily Driver. 

I'm a non-smoker and have no pets. Clean title. Minor body damage (a few scrapes and paint). I have kept very good record of maintenance while I've had the car and if you contact me, I would be happy to share my maintenance record and car fax with you via email. The car runs well as long as you keep up on the oil. I'm also throwing in the floor mats, the club, rubberized trunk liner, and the sun shade.

When I bought this, I put in quite a bit of work regular maintenance wise. As a result, it has a lot of new consumables. All of the old parts were replaced due to age and condition.

**********************************************************

Like I said a lot of new consumables but there are a few things that the car needs done relatively soon. The Belts were recommended to be changed at some point but they work fine right now.

On June 2nd, 2018 I discovered a small crack in the windshield. Looks like a stress crack to me but it's an old car and the windshield is probably original. There's no leak that I see so it doesn't need to be replaced but if you want to replace it, I found a quote for $227 online.

The interior needed some work cleaning it when I got it and I brought it up to my daily drive standards, that being said, there are some cosmetic rips on the passenger side and a small crack in the rear bumper. The title is clean and a Car Fax shows the car has been in no reported accidents or damage. 

All that being said, I am willing to Negotiate starting at $2,400. I'm happy to answer questions about the car and send a maintenance record as well as a Car Fax.

If you have cash make me a reasonable offer and drive it home, but don't lowball me. Swap is worth at least $1,200 and has about $1,000 in aftermarket parts. May consider trades for 4wd/awd cars but looking for cash. Come with all new $400 tires.

191,XXX on original cluster.

Roughly 140,XXX on swap but that's just word of mouth, no paperwork but engine is spotless(look at pics).

Motor runs flawless, no BS and pulls hard for Non-Vtec.

Was our primary daily until we bought a new car. Car has been garaged and still daily driven.

Pros;

Fresh paint

Viper alarm with working Fob

Super clean interior, Pioneer BT stereo hands-free, wired for subs.

Has working cold A/C, power steering is there but not hooked up, need a B20Z2 bracket to hook up (original D-series pump)

All electric interior functions work

DC Headers4-1/Unbranded cat-back exhaust

Enkei 16in. wheels

Act Sport 6 puck sprung clutch

Act XACT Flywheel Streetlite 

Rebuilt starter

New distributor TD-85U

New Denso wires, NGK spark plugs

Cons;

Paint looks good (Sunrise Red) but has imperfections, it's a 10-foot paint job.

CEL on currently. Believe it to be cluster related or pinout on distributor.

Code developed after brand new distributor was installed a few months back and RPM gauge has sense then not worked. (Does not affect drivability, AGAIN it's driven daily) as I stated before I believe it may be a faulty cluster, or possibly incorrect pinout on distributor harness, maybe even a ground. No engine light though

I will include the original distributor and any other extras I may have in the shop with the sale, old distributor seemed to have weak spark and was on it's way out hence why a new one was installed
It is fast for a civic and wired for subs

I have been using this car to commute to and from work for five years.  It has been a reliable car.  I'm not going to shine you on, it's no gem (see pictures).  I'm selling it because I recently purchased a newer model.  Would be a great car for someone making short trips (student, local) or you could turn it into a mobile sound system for tailgating.

THE BAD
I spun a rod bearing shortly after getting it running. So mad you cannot imagine. The oil pressure warning light never came on it just started knocking and seized. took about 3 city blocks from WTF is that sound to HOLY F- NOOO. Anyway, I bought a junkyard 6-bolt to rebuild, tore it apart to find that everything looked great inside despite having sat for a number of years before Pick a Part got it. I pulled the ECU from the parts car and it was filled with silicone where the caps leak so I suspect that was the issue the previous owner was fighting when it got parked. since then its sat inside with the car and it no longer turns. 

-to summarize, it comes with an entire 6-bolt, tore down to a short-block, and all the parts in totes (plus many extra). 

EXTRA PARTS
Motor I just mentioned
Front Mount intercooler made for a 1G with fogs (They work, I kept them)
255 Fuel Pump
evo 560cc injectors
2G MAF with hard intake pipe and cone filter
3-guage radio bezel for a single-DIN head unit
Glowshift Boost/oil pressure/air-fuel guages
extra ECUs, coils, cams, LOTS of little parts from my years of Mitsu hoarding.
broken passenger outer handle, its a DSM thing...
I was collecting parts for a well-rounded, reliable, comfortable daily with slightly more power than stock.  

Selling makes me sad.

Recent service within past 1,000 miles includes new timing belt/water pump, serpentine belt, and radiator. I installed a Kenwood DMX7704s aftermarket radio that supports apple car play, android auto, Bluetooth, rear camera, and dash cam(dash cam not included). Over 80% tread life on tires. These cars are hard to come. Clean Oregon title. Call for more info. 

For being on the road for 12 years, the exterior is in good condition. It could use some time with a buffer but I don't have the resources for that right now. 

The interior is in good condition as well. The driver's seat has the most wear on it, but the middle and third-row seats are in excellent condition. There are no tears in the seats, but there is a loose stitch on the passenger door panel. It's only a minor flaw, though. It is also a non-smoker car. 

The car is mechanically sound. The car runs great, and I'm going to be sad driving anything else. It will need an oil change in about 1000 miles. All power seats, auto windows, sunroof, heated seats, reverse tilt side mirrors, rain-sense wipers, power telescope steering wheel working properly. The only functions that do not work are the steering wheel buttons(due to aftermarket radio) and memory position seats. 

The recent service was performed by a master Toyota technician that replaced the timing belt, water pump, hydraulic tensioner, serpentine belt, and radiator(with new coolant) within the past 1000 miles. 

This is my personal car and I have the title in hand registered in my name. Call or text at

It also has a trailer hitch and a fresh oil change and air filter. 
This vehicle is beautiful and in immaculate condition. 
I'm looking to get out from under the payments and into something a little smaller. The ONLY issue this vehicle has, is that the driver side door has a tired window regulator which makes the window sluggish sometimes.
Also, contrary to popular belief, Nissan did make 2WD Xterra's... This is a REAR WHEEL DRIVE Xterra, not a 4x4. This is the second Xterra I've owned, the first was a 4x4, and I actually only ended up using the 4WD only once in four years. These short, wide wheel bases do very well in snow and offroad, and get better mileage than their 4x4 counterparts.
The 4.0L V6 gets about 18 to 20 miles to the gallon, and is definitely no slouch on the highway. It'll put you back in your seat! 
There is one tiny spot on the driver side seat where the fabric is becoming a little bit thread bare... But it's hardly noticeable.

It runs perfect in all weather conditions and has been more than reliable on my trips. Here is a run down of what's included:

- 2000 Ford Taurus (FWD, 6 cylinder, clean title), blue, currently wearing summer tires with plenty of tread left
- set of 4 winter tires with about 70-80% tread left on them
- set of 2 snow chains
- bluetooth radio transmitter (hook up your phone and play your music over the radio)
- Annual Northwest Forest Pass (bought in March 2018)
- 1 premium car wash at Kaady Car Wash
- replacement lamp for head lights

Car Features:
- Power Steering
- Power Windows (all 4 windows)
- Cruise Control
- 3rd fold-out front row seat

As you can see, it's ready to go explore and adventure!
Some peripheral parts that are new:
- new brakes in August
- new wash water pump this December 
- new starter in May

The only downside to the car is that the paint is not super nice anymore on the corners of the rear bumper, so there's a minor cosmetic issue.

Full size 285/75/16 Toyo MT spare in factory location
Dynatech split flow mufflers installed
Powder coated satin black, 8 wide American made wheels
65% Falken Wildpeak AT3/W tires (AMAZING traction) 
Some relatively new front end components, pitman arm, idler arm, passenger wheel bearing and CV axle, one upper ball joint, one tie rod.

It has rock chips in the paint from gravel roads, it has dents in the bed from the previous owner. It has scratches from using it as a truck and hauling stuff, some mountain pinstripes from driving past bushes while in the woods. 

A/C currently does not work. It's being worked on in spare time
Clock spring in steering column needs replaced. The driver airbag and steering wheel buttons don't work because of this. 


Was my daily driver/tow rig for small local things (cars, firewood, building materials, small boat)
I bought a new diesel, and don't need this truck anymore.
Reasonable offers entertained. Trades considered, but I need 3000 in cash at a minimum with trade.
Clean title in my name.
Only contact me to BUY the truck. Scammers and solicitors will be tormented verbally... A lot

Truthfully, this has been a fantastic car. I've had it for twelve years, and it's only needed to go to the shop twice. It hasn't broken down for 4-5 years, and has only needed flat tires fixed. Battery has died once or twice but that's probably my fault.  Runs great. I make ~60 mile round trip to Corvallis and back 3-4 times per week. Body is in great shape. Interior is in good shape. Some rust stains in trunk. Roughly 25-30 MPG. Forest Green, 187,000 miles,

Comes with free doughnut (spare tire) and a rusty jack and tire iron!

Known problems:  The only real faults are the window motors are broken, meaning they can't be rolled up and down. Neither of the back 2 work, but they'll stay up. The shotgun one is stuck down, which sucks. Driver one works intermittently.
2 semi-large cracks are on the windshield, but do not impede vision.
Right sideview mirror is taped on.
AC works only sometimes.
One of the tiny fog lights is out. You don't need it anyways. Back left blinker is out.
One hubcap is cracked.
Sideview mirror controls are missing.
Needs an oil change.
 Otherwise tip-top.

If you have any questions or want to take this beast out for a test-drive, please email me.

I have achieved up to 80 miles on a single charge and live in mountains where my elevation for a round trip to town drops 2,000 feet and then back up.  With instant torque off the line it will pull away from many other economy cars and handles quite well with the low center of gravity.  With fairly aggressive driving and AC running cold, I have no problem reaching 60+ miles per charge in moderate weather.  It does quite well in the snow and I have a extra set of steel rims that may be available with Michelin X-Ice snow tires if you are interested or live in a snow area.  I think it will only take cable chains, but with the X-Ice tires I have never had to put the chains on, even in 6"" of snow on the road, I just plowed though it.  

I usually get about 3 miles / kWh so the cost to drive 3 miles will be the cost of 1 kWh of electricity.  It adds about 250kWh / month to the electric bill when I drive about 750 miles each month.

It has new summer tires with only a few thousand miles on them and very good tread left.  It includes a 120V charger (level 1) which works well but takes 2-3x longer than a level 2 charger (240V).  I charged with a level 1 for several months until I installed a level 2 EVSE.  The cars onboard charger is a 3.3kWh, so at a completely drained battery it will charge in about 8 hours.

This car has driver and passenger side airbags, daytime running lamps.

This car has been upgraded with the following:  New front 5-1/4"" speakers, added rear speakers, rear tinted windows and tinted rear hatch window, daytime running lamps,  External PCU charger fuse-holders, Automatic delay on ac / heater on startup.  Trans-axle has had the 25,000 mile oil change and that is about all that is required for maintenance other than wiper fluid and tire rotation.

This car is located in in northern California.  The reason I am posting this in the Portland area is because I believe if this car is sold out of the state of California, your local state rebate for all electric vehicles may still be applied to this car.  Also Portland has a Think Service center and about 60-70 other Think's locally.  (for example: There is a $2500 rebate in Oregon and their website states if the vehicle has not been registered in the state, it is eligible for the rebate.  Disclaimer:  It is your responsibility to confirm it will be eligible in your state for any rebate.  Rebate has been claimed for California sale and car is registered in California through 2019)  There may also be utility rebates for electric vehicles.  For example, PG&E offers a $500 rebate and all you need is your registration address to match your PG&E billing address.

If you wonder why the cost is so inexpensive it is because it was purchased for under $20,000 and has had a rebate of $2,500 applied in CA and a $7,500 federal tax credit and a $500 PG&E utility rebate.  So my cost was about $11,600 (with tax) after all the incentives.  Subtract 5 years of depreciation and you get a nice entry level EV for under $5,000

last 6 months it has gotten new; injection pump, fuel pump, leveling kit, fuel wheels, tires, Moog ball joints, Moog tie rods, Red head steering box, steering stabilizer, alternator, starter, serpentine belt, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.

Cons:
its a 17 year old truck it has plenty of dints and scratches, paint is still good for the most part hood and roof like normal 2nd gens, 3rd gear synchro is getting weak but you can still find it it with ease. 

I still owe the bank a little money, so yes it has a clean and clear title, so we can either go down to the bank and either transfer it to you or we can pay it off right then and there.

Christina W
in the last week- 5 star review
Dan''s Automotive is a legit and very friendly place. I was skeptical at first because a lot of auto places with cars in my price range are deceptive. Most say no interest no credit checks then as soon as they hear I'm not rolling in money the story changes and lots of interest and credit checks start happening. Not with Dan's! We went over the entire payment plan and there was no interest or hidden fees. Literally NO CREDIT CHECK. They have excellent customer service. Kirk was a great help and super friendly person. I'll most likely buy my next car from this place as I'm super happy with the friendly service and awesome suv that I bought. Thanks a bunch guys!

It has leather seats, a old school sell phone, cruise control and one of the back seats converts to a car seat for toddlers. I just did a full tune up at $500+ at Johns auto repair in Corvallis and brand new Cooper AT wheels. I love this truck, it's taken me over the rough snowy Santiam Pass a few times with no issues, I was passing the big snow plow trucks! It's a very stong truck and I'm the 3rd owner. The first was a rental company and then an elderly couple, so it has been well taken care of, only main issue is the high mileage. The elderly couple drove it back and forth to Arizona. So mostly all highway miles. But they got into a fender bender, (front bumber and hood have been replaced) and so it's sitting on a reconstructed title. Has a driver door keypad to lock and unlock. I'm selling cause we got a newer family truck, so no need for it.
