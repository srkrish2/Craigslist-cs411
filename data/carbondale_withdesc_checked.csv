All service work was done by Ford and it's up on all it's maintenance including a fresh transmission and cooling system flush.

The vehicle is in excellent condition and needs nothing to pass state inspections. The only thing to note is that the tread on the tires are getting worn down, they will pass inspection but are getting worn.

5 speed manual transmission. New tires less than 7,000 miles on them,
50 MPG, great little commuter car, runs and drives great, does not use, burn oil or smoke. 

Dependable is an understatement since it's been in my family for 15 years. My dad owned it for 13 years and 2 years myself. If it wasn't dependable it would of left our family years ago. Only reason I'm selling is it's been just a back up car and my wife doesn't know how to drive a manual transmission so it doesn't get driven much except when ours or a family members car is in the shop it's the go to car. 

Besides general maintenance not much has been done to it. I did put a new distributor cap and timing belt on it this year. Made it run even better. This car could easily drive another 100K Miles. The only damage to the body is behind the drivers door where a Prius backed into it and some rust under the door. 

It's a basic bare bones car, manual windows, no A/C (came from the factory that way), no radio. Not flashy, but it makes up in dependability and a wonderful work car. Not an interstate car per say, but great highway/city car. Can cruise 60MPH all day. It can pay for itself just in the gas you'll save. I've never been able to put $20 in gas at fill up.

There's a reason why the Geo Metro is on the top ten list of most fuel efficient cars of all time. They don't make them like this anymore.

The 2012 model year was the last year that the 5.0L V8 was standard for the XF. If is the same engine used in the Jaguar XK GT car and will easily throw you back in the seats. This is the portfolio edition which includes a real leather dash, steering wheel, leather air conditioned and heated front seats, all leather back seats, headlights that turn with you as you drive, automatic headlight washers, suede leather headliner, sunroof, front and back bumper radar, rear view camera, GPS, internal hard drive for 10 CD's (it rips the CD's to the ""changer""), a loud and crisp stock radio, and every basic option beyond these. I purchased this car with under 8000 miles about 4 years ago. It has always been in the garage, driven in the rain less than 5 times, and never used as a daily driver. For what you get in this car for the price, I easily consider it an incredible value for the money. Especially since the first owner and now I have taken the bulk of the depreciation curve. 

If you are new to Jaguar, don't be concerned by the brand and high maintenance costs. The engine has a lot of Ford pedigree and I get my oil changes at Marion Ford for about $125. You only need to change the oil once a year or at 10,000 miles. As you can see from the amount of miles on this car (about 26,500), I opted for the once per year oil change. I've had no problems with the car ever. It includes 2 Keys, one has wear and tear, the other looks like new. 

Turn heads and enjoy top luxury with this gorgeous British sports sedan. With an original sticker price over $70,000, low miles, clean Car Fax (no accidents, no damage, maintenance records), it's a great value for the price!

Serious inquiries only. I prefer a local sale or one to an established car buying organization (VROOM, CARVANA, etc.). Contact me by phone only please to set up an appointment to see the car.

I included pictures of them before I did my front end swap when they were still on the car as well as how they are now (which is just a little dusty/dirty)

Front bumper and rear bumper are in great condition. If u painted them it would look brand new. Hood is almost mint has some scratches and a chip behind the passenger side pop up but the paint on it held flawlessly. Front bumper had clear turn signals before I took it off. I also have the 2 oem bumper reinforcements but they are rusted as u can see so I'll sell those for almost nothing. Traded the led headlights already.

Has had Rotella synthetic since 50K miles. I have all records from day one. Has 4"" exhaust, and firestone airbags. I installed a deep Alison trans pan and filter at 100K. All this was new at 187K. Rear U-Joints, Axle seals, Upgraded tie rods, wheel bearings, ball joints, upper control arms, pitman arm, idler arm, and braces for both, Bosch injectors, fuel pressure reg, adjusted valves, cat filter adapter. New t-stats at 212K the old ones stuck open. New tensioner, idler pulleys, and belt at 212K. Has a hypertech programmer thats been on it since 60K set on the 87hp setting and never changed. I change the fuel filter every oil change which I do when the computer oil life says 50%. I change the Alison spin on filter every 3rd oil change. I replaced the transfercase half with an aluminum one at 170K. I just had the stepper motors replaced on the gauges. Replace some brake lines, but not all. New Battery's feb of 16. Has the stock stereo and the cd player don't work. The drivers seat has one sewed spot. No other interior problems. Most of it looks new. It's due for a trans fluid replacement. I have 2 gallons of transynd that goes with the truck. I have the stock exhaust that goes with it. I have an aluminium louvered tailgate that goes with it. This truck has never gone into limp mode, NEVER. Every single thing works except cd player. The exterior has a dent, and some limb marks. The cab corners are rusted and the rockers are just starting. My cousin was in his 60's and I'm 47. I've never beat this truck. Its only been a tow/work truck. It has been very well maintained. I even keep the frame and rear axle painted. I'm getting another truck is the only reason for selling. If you want a great super clean truck come look at this one. I'm still driving it so mileage will go up slightly daily. 11,500 OBO Clear title in my name in my hand.

I'm just leaving the country for a couple months then leaving to college again so I really don't have time to mess with it anymore. Clean title. Pretty sweet car. I'll trade for a motorcycle or car or bike maybe. Or throw me a cash offer. The car will run once it's fixed, I just wish I had the time to mess with it.

I have owned the car since July 2015, I bought the car from a guy in Los Angeles. Avus Blue 95 M3 with 124K miles. OBD1, no traction control. S50 engine with a 5speed manual trans. I will delete this ad once it is sold so I still have it. It is in good condition, quite a few new parts but could still use a few miscellaneous things. Driver side fender is a DOT fender and has paint chipping. 

Suspension (as of now installed on car):

Stance coilovers (1 set of Swift springs, 1 set of Stance springs) 9K 12K spring rates
E46 front lower control arms (still have E36 arms I took off)
Condor Speed Shop solid delrin E46 LCA conversion bushings
E90 inner tie rods (have set of brand new E36 inners as well)
E36 outer tie rods
TMS rear lower control arms 
Whiteline 28mm front sway bar
TMS adjustable front sway endlinks
ECS tuning front strut bar
Rear strut mount reinforcements
TMS 10mm wheel spacers 2x
Stud conversion from ECS tuning (Mishimoto lug nuts)

Engine:

S50 is completely stock
Borla catback exhaust
Fluidyne 44mm aluminum radiator (9/15)
Stewart water pump (9/15)
Thermostat (9/15)
Overflow container (9/15)
Samco upper and lower rad hoses (9/15)
Aluminum thermostat housing (RTV sealed to ensure no leaks)
Fan clutch and fan (9/15)

Interior:

All stock except for Momo steering wheel. Has Vader seats. Driver seat has a small tear or two in it but generally for Dove interior its in good shape. The leather probably needs a good clean and condition. The leather cover for the glove box door fell off, I still have it of course it just needs put back on. Have the original floor mats. Carpet is in pretty good shape, could use a good cleaning. No cracks in the dash. 

The car could need:

-High pressure power steering hose needs replaced, it leaks power steering fluid. Its not a bad leak, I have had to put fluid in twice in my ownership. 
-Glove box leather cover put back on as mentioned earlier.
-Car sometimes says ""Check coolant level"" when it is started but goes away after about a minute. Im not sure why, it started doing it occasionally in May 2016. Maybe faulty coolant level sensor?
-VANOS makes noise like they all do eventually, solenoid will need replaced or rebuilt 
-Passenger side skirt is missing

Parts not installed:
Rear subframe reinforcement plates
CSS solid delrin rear subframe bushings
Rear sway bar reinforcement tabs
Front subframe reinforcement plates
CSS solid delrin differential bushings
BMW factory X brace with hardware
Rear wheel bearings
Cabin air filter
Mishimoto Electric Fan Conversion with fan housing
Mishimoto Aluminum Expansion Tank
There may be more, I will update as I remember/ find it.

The rear drivers door handle and actuator are broken but I have replacements for both.  I recently replaced the front passenger's door handle, but it doesn't seem to work correctly.  The gas gauge doesn't work correctly, but it's just a problem with that cluster, because the DIC works perfectly.

This Volvo was our middle daughter daily driver. The car was involved in a accident.....she hit a deer. We replaced the headlight and never got to fix the rest of the damage due to minor damage on the hood and the front bumper.
The insurance company totaled the vehicle but kept clean title on it. It may appear as Total lost vehicle on CarFax....
There is all maintenance done and everything works. 
The car is used and has some dents...nothing major but it is worth to mention.

Simply changed the oil and kept it maintained. I have done quite a list of upgrades to the car, they are as follows: 
HPA K04 Hybrid Turbo
HPA Intake manifold
HPA exhaust down pipe
ECS Tuning air intake system
IE front mount Intercooler
Malone Tuning Custom Stage 3 Tune

The car sits at 300 AWHP, so it's very fun to drive. Like i said no problems with the car, but i'm looking to get an automatic. Only thing that could be changed because it's annoying is the park brake squeaks when you set it.

03 Chevy Silverado Z71 LT

I'll give you the run down on this truck.

Transmission fluid was leaking and i had a hole in a manifold gasket whatever that is so I sent to Meineke and spent like $2,000. Then I get it back and the transmission was slipping so I got a used transmission from a junk yard and paid a mechanic labor to have it installed and apparently this ones junk to because it's still slipping. AAMCO transmissions said my $2,000 would of got the truck completely running but i didn't know about them. I did just drive it from Bunker hill to Wood River it runs smooth until you get up to about 45 - 50 mph. What I've had done this year to it is a new transfer case & fuel pump. I have receipts for those. I'm 99% sure I've got a lot more done to it as well as in replaced hoses and lines but I'd have to look at the receipts. I'm 100% done spending money on this truck. The mechanic says transmission is the main issue. I'm sure there's other areas that will need attention at some point. Engine seams good, no major noises or leaks.

* light rust over the passenger back wheel that can't really be seen.
* Rims are painted black by myself but they actually don't look that bad. 
* Driver side and passenger front seats both have small rips as shown in the pictures. 
* Rocker panels are rusted & there's a small rust hole in the bumper also shown in pictures.

I just moved back from college in Colorado so it has a clean Colorado title. 

Will come with the original wheels on an extra set of tires, original headlights and the original tailights 

I've put black rims, halo headlights, darkened tailights, tinted windows, and a carbon fiber cover on the hood and side mirrors. This is a nice little car, it is an 05 so it has a couple door dings and fading paint and normal body wear. 

I runs great, I've never had any problems with it. It would be a great starter car. I replaced the battery and alternator May 2017, new performance tires last October. It also just got an oil change a couple of weeks ago. The only issue is the drivers side window is off track so whenever you roll it down it will slide around. I don't want to mess with fixing it. And there is body damage on the back bumper/quarter panel.

It gets serviced every 4 thousand miles. Runs and drives good. 5,000 miles on new tires. We have had the truck since 197,000. We bought it with some front end damage. We replaced the front bumper and grill, the front passenger fender and the passenger light.  It does have a rebuilt title. Rebuilt title just states that it was once salvage and now it has been rebuilt to be legal on the road. Has been inspected by an inspection facility in Decatur and fully inspected by the State of police in Springfield. The truck doesn't use any oil but the rear end may need the seal replaced and the gas gauge doesn't always work.

It has 135,000 miles on it. It has the 5.7 hemi in it and it does have 3/4 axles under it, the only thing keeping it from being a 3/4 ton is the suspension isn't as beefy as a 3/4 ton. I have owned it for almost two years and haven't had a minutes trouble with it. The only thing I have done is put new spark plugs, boots, and wires in it at 120,000. The interior is in great condition I just don't have pictures of it at the moment. Will try to upload them soon. It does have rock chips and paint bubbles as pictured. I bought it like that and it just never bothered me enough to fix it. The only reason I am selling it is because I just bought a house and want to get out of my truck payment. Call/text is the best way to get ahold of me. If I don't answer leave a message. I work late this time of year.

I love this truck but find, due to my health and small income that it's best I part with it. This truck is like new, has new Goodyear tires, new full factory side steps, tonneau cover, new bed liner and a special ordered moon visor painted to match truck. Before I got it, it was company owned and had regular maintenance performed and I kept that up. Interior is near perfect also. All the bells and whistles on this one. Factory lighted fold out trailer mirrors that cost around $500 each. Bug deflector and wind visors on doors.  I don't drive it enough now to warrant the payments since I'm a disabled vet on a tight pension. If you want a great truck that looks super nice, you need to see this one. This one has the 8 speed automatic transmission too. The paint color is actually magnesium gray metal flake. Even has the power rear window and power tailgate lock!

Truck performs perfectly and will avg. 17-20 mpg. depending on how you drive. To prolong the life of the engine and eliminate future emission issues I performed the EGR and DEF Delete. Truck has Flo-Pro 4"" exhaust with muffler and SCT Livewire tuner and S and B cold air intake.

I have all the parts to rebuild it I just don't have time. It blew a head gasket. I have new timing belt, radiator, head gasket kit and new head bolts. Slight front fender damage from hitting deer. It's a great car and deserves to be back on the road. For the weekend mechanic this would be a great car and a bargain. The hard part is done. It has a 3.0L 24 valve twin dual over head cam. It is Hyundai's luxury model of that year. Looks like a Lincoln in the front and Similar to a Jaguar in the back. 5 speed automatic slap stick transmission. Super fun to drive. It also has new Windshield that was replaced before it was parked. If I can't sell it by Friday I will be forced to scrap it. I can get at least $220 from scrap and sell all the new parts and make more then what I'm asking. The car is to nice to scrap. Especially since I have all the parts. Except it will need two front tires (I used them for my s10) and a Battery. I will send pictures upon request. $500 or best offer.

Its a sharp vehicle that used to be my daily driver until the transmission started having issues.  It runs and drives but wont go above 30ish. Once the incident happened, I parked it to prevent doing more damage. It has just over 300,000 miles, however the motor has been very well maintained and the top end of the motor was redone less than 2 years ago. It has the 4.3L v-6 in it and is a very strong motor.  Still has a lot of power and runs as smooth as ever.  The transmission could be an easy fix, I haven't looked into it, I just replaced it with a crew cab truck for a growing family. So at this price, even after the transmission repair, you could make money on this truck. My loss could be your gain. Thanks for looking. No scams, no I do not need help selling.

Bought it to take it on trails but have finished my Rubicon and use it.  Trailed this twice since I bought it. Its a fun little beast.

Two tires are decent.  Two could be cut.  Have two brand new swampers on the way ($600) 

Brand new spartan front locker ($250) in box ans posion spyder bombshell diff cover ($100) 

Tub is rough, frame seems solid.  Runs like a champ.  Some slow fluid leaks and a tire has a small leak over a couple days.  

I wouldn't drive it down a highway. No speedo. Death wobbles a bit when you wind it up. 

$2500 without 2 new tires, locker and diff cover. 

$3300 with the above.  

If you want something to thrash on, this is it.  That Chevy 4.3 is a solid motor. If you want a DD, move along. This isn't it without a lot more work.

Had to move it out of the garage to work on my wagon. While I'd love to get this thing on the road but have too many projects. Has a L16 & 4 speed manual in it. I had it running earlier this year on a weber carb I borrowed from my 4 Door. Just needs someone with space and time.

Interior: Floor is pretty solid even up around the foot wells. Blue Vinyl bench seat is currently in the parts trucks cab.

Exterior: Worst part on this truck is the drivers side rocker, thankfully the rocker on the parts truck is there. Bed sides show dings from getting used as a truck should but no holes, bed floor is also fairly solid. Parts truck bed is in similar good condition.

Drivetrain: Engine fired up running off a motorcycle gastank & ran well after an oil change. Clutch & Brake lines are currently dry and need replaced so wasn't able to drive it around at all. Would recommend atleast a tune up & rebuilding the old hitachi carb that's on it as I've since removed the weber.

Mechanical: Brakes should be redone, I have new wheel cylinders & master cylinder for it. I was going to make new brake lines for it since it's a really simple system. Also cab and bed are off the parts frame so fabricating them would be pretty easy.

All in all it'd be a great project for somebody with the space/time. For me working out of an un-powered shed it's just too much. My loss your gain. Clean Illinois Title in my name in hand.

Come's with a complete parts truck & the parts to finish up the brakes and any other 521 parts I have if you offer close to asking price.

Also have a few other engine / transmissions I could sell along with the truck depending on offer (KA24DE/5speed & L20B/5speed)

Also transfer case was recently rebuilt. 4x4 works good. Truck doesn't have any weird noises or leaks. All gauges and lights work also. It does have dings, dents, and scratches. Interior is in good condition.  I used it to drive back and forth to work and kept it well maintained. Now for the BAD- the service brake system shows up on the cluster and truck will not shift correctly when it does. Transmission didn't have any issues at all. I believe to think it's a bad sensor or loose wire. I don't have time or money to mess with it so I'm selling it.. asking 2000 obo$ clean and clear title. For anymore questions. Text or call  
. May be interested in trading depends what you have?

My 1926 Chrysler model 58 three window coupe was put away about 8 years ago when the old gentleman died. It is very solid and No Rust..   I revived it and got it running again by replacing with new points, plugs, plug wires, rotor, cap, coil, other wiring, took apart the gas vacuum tank and cleaned it, dropped the gas tank and cleaned it, got the gas gauge working again, dropped the oil pan and cleaned it, new oil of course, greased every fitting I could find, cleaned and made better connections to anything involve with starting, and other things. All windows are good and function.  The interior is usable as is but bottom seat cushion is ratty. Holds good oil pressure.  Just come and look at it for your own curiosity.   Finding a rust free solid coupe body is hard to come by. Title is in my name.

This started off as a 1995 Jeep Wrangler and has turned into what it is now.  I'll miss a lot of things, but I'll list out the majority.

388 stroker with Holley fuel injection (was a fresh motor when I got it a little over a year ago.  I do not have paperwork on the build, but it is a pretty healthy motor).  Has an MSD 6T, MSD Billit Distributor, MSD coil.  Rev limiter is setup on the Holley. 

TH350 transmission with transmission cooler and fan.  This trans was just recently gone through at the end of last year.  I blew apart a sprag and put in a stock valve body rather than the manual valve body that was in it.  All seals and clutches were inspected and they were fairly new.

NP231C HD transfer case with advanced adapters kit

Ford 9"" rear.  4 linked on coils with a truss, spool, Moser shafts, 4.88 gears, and disk brake conversion

Front Dana 44, 3 linked on fox coil overs, Chromoly shafts, locker, new ring and pinion as of the end of last year (4.88's), warn premium hubs.

Allied 17x9.5 beadlocks with 38.5x13.50x17 boggers.  Tires are new, they have 1 wheeling trip and about 30 miles on them

Hydro assist steering, stock wrangler box, drilled out stock chevy pump.

Warn 9000 w/ synthetic rope

I just got done redoing the front of the cage.  Originally it was designed without a top and doors in mind.  This winter I purchased a hard top, I already had the half doors, and purchased new glass for the windshield.  I bent new tubing and redesigned it so now the top fits, and doors fit.  The only thing that I do not have are the soft inserts.  You will need to find a set of TJ uppers and cut/reweld one of the rods and you'll be enclosed fully.

The Jeep drives down the road decently enough to drive it on occasion to town or to drive it to go wheel.  It's tagged and has insurance.   Currently the only thing the Jeep needs is a new 4wd linkage.  Long story short, the old one broke, a wrench welded to a piece of steel then bolted to the transfer case was used, and I bought a novak shifter and have issues with alignment so it doesn't work.  You can go back to the old setup, or make a new one, or get a cable setup.",,good,8 cylinders,4wd,gas,,white,,clean,automatic,offroadhttps://carbondale.craigslist.org/cto/d/corvette/6626450869.html,corvette,1990 Chevy corvette,159 weber rd,12500,"90 corvette #

I drive the car so the miles will go up. Must see in person how clean and nice it is. Always garaged, 4.9 Liter V8 motor, NOT a north star motor. Due the research the 4.9 motor was probably the best motor Cadillac made as far as dependability. Automatic transmission, super cold AC. 

What I've done since ownership was replace the tires which have only 3,000 miles on them, I had my mechanic due a top engine clean, to clean out the carbon from not being driven much, Also replaced the spark plugs, wires, and an EGR valve. All recommended by my mechanic. Has a fresh oil change with less than a 1,000 miles on it. All together $1400 in maintenance and have all the receipts. This car needs nothing, I would drive it across country and not think twice. It does have a couple spots where the paint peeled, you can see in the pictures. 

Price is negotiable, but no low ball offers. I personally have never ridden in a car this comfortable. Rides and drives like a new car. Everything works as it should.

Cummins!!

Up for sale is a very nice 2009 Dodge Ram 3500 4x4. This truck has the powerful 6.7L cummins diesel backed with a G56 6 Speed manual transmission. The truck has the painted to match bumpers and grill too! This Cummins has had lots of maintenance done to it recently and has more than enough power to pull any sort of load behind it. It has the beautiful rockstar wheels with brand new tires up front. The rear tires still have a decent amount of tread left also. This truck has been deleted so it gets great mpg along with the extra power. The truck has the FASS fuel filtration system on it to help ensure long injector life. This system runs a additional 2 fuel filters that have just been replaced. This has the top of the line parts on the truck as you can see from the cold air intake, and the 5 inch exhaust with muffler. This beautiful Dodge has had the entire front end gone through. Anyone that knows these dodges 99% of them out there need front end parts. This just got all new tie rod ends, drag link, upper and lower ball joints, along with new shocks all around. We also replaced the clutch in the truck. We did not use a cheap autozone clutch set up or even a stock one because we know they will not hold the power the truck makes and will go out quickly with the next owner. We put a high dollar LUK heavy duty clutch/flywheel set up in it. It still lets it drive like stock but holds alot more power for when pulling those heavy loads. We are pricing this one under book value to sell it with a quick hassle free deal. You will not find a truck like this with the amount of money into it for a price like this. The truck does have a slight shake at idle but it goes away once over 1,000 rpms and you do not notice it a single bit when driving it around. If you would like to set up a time to come and see the truck and take it on a nice test drive give me a call/text",,like new,6 cylinders,4wd,diesel,211000,,,clean,manual,https://carbondale.craigslist.org/cto/d/2008-pt-cruiser/6627348108.html,2008 PT Cruiser,2008 chrysler pt cruiser,,4000,"This is a great car!

This truck only has 148k original miles. These are vary rare to find with a 6 speed manual transmission. If your in the market for a truck to pull a camper this is one of the best trucks you will find. This one being 2 wheel drive you get the better fuel mileage along with the coil front springs for the better ride quality. This also being a 2000 model it still has the forged rods in the legendary 7.3 diesel engine.  This lets them handle more power and makes the engine stronger. This F350 is by far the nicest most well taken care of one I have seen to date. This truck is a one owner truck bought in 2000 and was serviced at the local ford dealer for every single oil change or maintenance item recommended. All this is shown on the Carfax report, along with it showing it has never been involved in a accident. You will not find another one with this sort of maintenance history. 


This truck being a XLT model, it has the power windows and locks, key less entry, power mirrors, towing mirrors, sliding rear window, running boards, aluminum wheels, privacy glass, and the camper package. This also has a nice Linex spray in bed liner to keep the bed in great condition. As you can see from the pictures it has never had anything heavy in the bed causing it any sort of damage like most that you see. Of course the a/c and heat work perfect. The truck has zero play in the steering. After driving hundreds of these trucks this one by far drives the best and you can come see for yourself. This truck has zero rust on it either. There are no signs of it starting to bubble through either. Even the bed rails are not rusted. The rockers and cab corners are solid. The engine is as sound as you can get. The only modification to it is the K&N air filter in the factory air box. The truck still has factory exhaust with the factory muffler. It has newer A/T tires on it, nothing to aggressive to make a lot of noise going down the road, but with enough tread to get you through snow/dirt easily. The seats are in perfect shape. There is not any rips or stains, nor are their any weird smells. The headliner does not have any sagging at all, or any stains in it. This truck was never abused and it clearly shows that. The transmission shifts smooth as can be, with no free play in the shifter. The clutch feels strong with no slipping. 


We are pricing this one to sell quickly and hassle free at 12,800 It will be hard to find one in this sort of condition. They do not pop up often. I will be happy to go over the truck with you, and let you take it on a lengthy test drive. I am certain whoever looks at it first will take it home. Feel free to call me with any questions or to be the first person to take a look at it.",,like new,6 cylinders,rwd,diesel,148000,,,clean,manual,https://carbondale.craigslist.org/ctd/d/2011-ford-flex-limited/6627360688.html,2011 Ford Flex LIMITED,2011 Ford Flex,DIAMONDS TO DUST CREDIT OK!!,14990,"South Beach Motors

The good - Engine, Transmission and everything from front doors back!

The bad - Front end damage.  Raditor, A/C condensor, bumper, grill, lights, hood, drivers side fender and associated support brackets need to be replaced.  Typical front end collision stuff.  Air bags were deployed which also broke the windshield.  

You can hear engine run.  You may even be able to drive up on a trailer to transport.  The radiator is busted so you can't drive far.  

Two brand new tires on rear (2000 miles on them).

Most important thing: The engine knocks. Assuming rod knock. It is obvious. I have not torn down the engine yet but it definitely appears to be a rod knock. 
I have videos of the car and they will be listed at the very bottom of this listing.
NO TRADES

DETAILS
* It runs - but I will not guarantee for how long, nor will I run it for more than a few seconds (see video).
* Straight 6 cyl engine - I believe it is the 196CI, but not 100%, I will verify this. It appears to be stock, but I can't tell for sure.
* Manual Trans - 3 speed on the column - Due to the knock, I have not put it in gear to test it out, but the previous owner said it 
worked well. The clutch pedal feels weird, but I have never messed with one of these cars. With the knocking, I was not going to 
put it in gear and put any load on the engine.
* For being a 1960, the the body is pretty solid. It does appear that there has been body work. The paint is not original and is 
nothing spectacular. 
* It will need a few floor pans. (videos show this). I did not pull up the flooring to do a complete inspection.
* The trunk appears to be solid.
* The glass is all good!!!
* Front seats fold down!!!
* Dash appears to be in fair condition.
* It appears to have the original or era specific carb. Has the glass float cover. Pretty damn cool!
* Missing the gas pedal
* Mag Slot wheels. Tires have good tread!
* MILES - Will update when I look.
* Air shocks in the back.
* Appears to have newer shocks and coils in the back. I was by the previous owner that he had more work done to the front 
suspension. I haven't verified this.
* Does have some body damage. Noted in the videos.
* These were the pics that I was sent when I picked it up. They make the paint look better. Videos give a better representation.

Very rare car with only 83000 miles. I do not drive this car very much and have decided to sell it.  Please read the following before contacting me.  To make a long story short, about a year and a half ago, all of the warning lights came on on the dash and the diagnosis was the ECU motor.  I was told by BMW that if I replaced the ECU, then the car would have to be relearned to the new motor by a certified BWM dealer.  I replaced the ECU motor and took it to BMW and they hooked the computer up to it and after 6 or so hours, they said that their machine would not recognize the new ECU motor and therefore they said I would need to buy a new ECU motor from them.  At the time I did not wish to have them do this so the car has been setting in my garage ever since.  It runs good as is, but all of the warning lights are on.  Many BMW owners have this problem and never fix it.  The car is super fast and will be one of the most exhilarating machines you will ever drive.  I hope to have another one some day.

This is an ""as is "" sale.  This is a 1989 RX7 GXL.  All electrics work.  Has had seat belt recall done.  It is a drivable project.  Meaning it is drivable but does have issues you need to know about before buying.  Firstly the engine.  It is the original engine.  All 3 apex seals on both rotors have 85-89 psi which is in spec.  It does not use oil or coolant.  I use Idemitsu oil's for pre-mix and engine oil.  Original OMP still hooked up but I add some to the tank as well.  AC seems to blow cold.  All fluids are new.  Tires in great shape.  I have replaced all the vacuum hoses, rebuilt the throttle body and replaced the intake gaskets.   There is also alot more I have done to this in the last 3 years I have owned it.  I literally cannot rememeber them all.  It is an automatic but I do have a 5 speed and all parts needed to do the swap.  The automatic transmission works but I feel its putting a drag on the motor at idle in gear.  Which brings me to the issues.  While driving its fine, can set the cruise control and go anywhere, however at a stop in gear it wants to die.  This can be taken care of by going into neutral or using one foot on the brake and other on the gas.  Radio is missing but I have another.  Exhaust manifold leaks a little, but I have a Pacesetter header and a new O2 sensor to go with it.  There are several other new and used parts to go with it.  In the last few weeks I replaced the smog pump, which on the RX7 acutally operates important actuators on the intake to increase power and has a pipe that goes to the cat to prevent clogging due to the RX7s natural oil burning.  Now that the pump is new it is blowing out alot of stuff and smokes awhile.  It will do this until the system gets cleaned out.  Reason why I have not had a chance to drive it since is one of the heater hoses blew the day I installed the smog pump.  I have all new coolant hoses to go with it.  It will drive up on a trailer but until the heater hose is replaced it can not be driven.  I really like this car but would prefer the money right now.  The paint is not the best and there is some surface rust on the sunroof.  I may consider trades but it would have to be something classic/vintage and drivable, like a Jaguar, Mustang, etc.  Due to issues in the past I prefer messaging me though craigslist before giving out numbers.",,fair,other,rwd,gas,,silver,compact,clean,other,https://carbondale.craigslist.org/cto/d/2008-jeep-wrangler-jk/6629534794.html,2008 Jeep Wrangler JK,2008 jeep wrangler,Farmington,16000,"Thinking about selling my 2008 Wrangler JK, runs and drives good..just looking at bigger options.

I can offer this without any of the above mentioned parts for $12,800

I have a well maintained 2013 Scion FRS I am selling. 94xxx

I have owned this car for over 3 years now and am in the market to sell it. I purchased it with 18k miles on it in September 2014

I have done the expensive spark plug change on this car around 65k miles

I have changed the transmission oil at 40k miles along with the rear diff.

Oil changes regularly between 3k and 5k miles at Vic Koeing in C'dale. They offered a lifetime powertrain as long as I own the car and take it to them for oil changes.

This car is also modified slightly. It has koni yellow struts with TRD springs on it. It also has a 2.5"" Perrin Cat-Back Exhaust.
Now I can lower the price a little and remove these items. I have the stock exhaust, struts and springs.
She also comes with an extra set of OEM wheels with some nice RE-71 tires on them.

I did autox this car and had it on the track a few times, but tell me what FRS that wasn't owned by anyone but a grandma or grandpa hasn't rode one hard. They can take it, it's what they were built for.

Also the title is owned by First Mid bank. We can go in there together, set you up with a loan and walk out the same day you owning the car. Or you can get your own loan and we can go to by bank together and transfer the title to your bank.

Now for the accident report.
1. The front bumper and hood has been replaced along with a headlight. This was due to a person backing into the car while it was parked.
2. The rear passenger side quarter was pulled back out due to also being hit another time in a parking lot, they also cracked the rear bumper and it was replaced at the same time.
3. I smoked a raccoon on the way home tearing the passenger side of the front bumper off and ripping out the fender liner. 

All body work above was done at Grithers in Murphysboro and paid for by my insurance...

4. Shortly after I received the car back from Grithers I hit another raccoon. It put a crack in the front bumper and miss aligned it a little. I haven't had the insurance fix it yet, but I may if we can't work around it. Price will go up if I have to fix.

Here I have a hard working 1994 Ford F-150. I bought it three years ago with 125k miles on it and have put a little work into it and have made it a reliable work and hunting truck for myself. I'm wanting to purchase my dads truck, so I'm selling mine.

Installed on 4-15-17

Please read the whole add, This is a RUNNING AND DRIVING vehicle that I would trust to drive anywhere. Car is pictured with 3 steel wheels and a honda wheel. You will get all the wheels, but i have a 4th steel that comes with the car. Two good tires and 2 tires that need replaced soon.

Please read the whole add before contacting me with questions. There is a parts car and ALOT of extra parts coming with it.

Here I have a 1988 Toyota MR2 NA, that means it's not supercharged, with around 187,000 miles. It is a 5 speed manual. There are alot of new parts on the motor and chassis and I will get to those in a list down below. 

This car was in a front end collision. It was backed into at a stop light and the thin metal plate that was meant to bend bent. THERE IS NO FRAME DAMAGE. I replaced the metal plate as you can see in one of the pictures with the one off the parts car.

The paint is nowhere near excellent, maybe good or fair condition, but this is a rare color and even being a two tone makes in even more rare. The windshield is cracked, Safelite in Carbondale will replace it for $190. Clear coat is peeling across the car, it has had tape on various parts for some reason or another. THERE ARE NO LEAKS, all the rubber seals are holding all the water on the outside of the car, as they should. I pressure washed all around every seal when cleaning the car this morning and there were NO LEAKS. Again the windshield is cracked.

The interior I would give a 7/10. For a 30 year old car there is one crack in the dash as pictured, and the shift boot is ripped so bad I just removed it. There are sparco racing seats with RJS Racing Equipment 5 point harnesses. Now both the seats and the harnesses are out of date to race with but they can still be used on the road and at HPDE and like events. The drivers side has a small burn hole in it assuming because the previous owner smoked, but I have aired the car out alot and it doesn't have a smoke smell anymore.

Mechanically this car is sound. There is a laundry list of new parts that I will include below. 186,6xx miles currently are on the car and motor. Compression across the cylinders are as followed. 180 - 180 - 200 - 160 

New parts with less than 100 miles, actually less than 5, but anyways.
Gates Timing belt with tensioner
brake rotors all 4 centric
brake pads all 4 corners (semi metallic)
brake hardware kits all 4 corners (the new brakes are not installed yet)
Gates Water pump
ASIN Oil Pump
Beck\arnley fuel filter
NGK spark plugs
Toyota Black oil pan gasket maker for oil pan gasket
MAHLE valve cover gasket kit with grommets
apex intake and exhaust gasket kits
fuel injector o-ring kit
o2 sensor (not installed quite yet, I am going to weld the new bung in this weekend hopefully)
trans fluid
matrix garage rear tie rods
Distributor Cap
Distributor Rotor
Spark Plug Wires

Now for the extra parts and parts car.

COMES WITH THE GOLD PARTS CAR. It's nearly complete. No title on parts car.
You also take all the parts I have for AW11. That is the rolling, not running, parts car with 4 black tubs full, a head, I think 3 pairs of seats, an extra trunk and a couple engine lids. There is about a truck load and a half of extra parts. There could be a deal worked out and I could possibly deliver the parts car and parts depending on purchase price. 

That should be all. If you are seeing this on Facebook check out Craigslist for more photos. Just search for 1988 Toyota MR2 and it should be one of them. Facebook only allows 10 photos where Craigslist allows over 20.

Call or text NO EMAILS please, I prefer text though because I am at work alot. If I don't answer and you call please leave a message.

This is an older restore car with documentation. Car runs good with no engine lights on. Paint shines nice but has small rock chips etc nothing bad. Interior is all there and not bad for a 28 yr old car but certainly not perfect.  Soft top is all there but vinyl not in good shape. Will need new floor pans in rear as the soft top leaked at some point . They are fairly inexpensive to replace.  Car shows 192k but speedometer quit working 2 months before it was parked according to previous owner. Car is a running driving project but would not take much to be a very nice car. Has had recent new exhaust work done and brakes etc are all good. Prices on these car have been steadily rising so great opportunity to get into one cheap. Priced below value to compensate for the few problems stated above. Can get more pics for those of you interested.
